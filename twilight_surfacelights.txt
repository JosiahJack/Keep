Textures that could generate surface lights (note: not needed for sky, using sunlight for that)

Highly likely to always need lights:
*lava1
*lavakell5
lava
+0lavfall
+1lvfall
barrow
baslt4_1
ceil1_3
central-gwin-cf //dashes for some reason
dragonwindow1
dragonwindow2

light3_3
light3_4
light3_5
light3_6
light3_7
light3_8
metal5_80
metal6_3
midwin
ogro30b
orangelight
r3_32sl1
r_microluminis // man I love this one
stngls

window01_2
window01_3
window01_4
window02_1

window2_2
window2_3

wyndraxwin

Moderately likely to need surface lights (handplace due to offset or might need to use in dark area??):
+0rtex4
arch2win
arch2winA
bigasswindow
demon2_b
demon_b
demon_r
dkt_window
eviljr
kceil_ml
mosaic5
pent1_r
q3a_door1
r2-centerw2 // dash for some reason
rtex018
rtex083
sancwind01
sarcophagus02
swine6d
swine6h
vitrail
towerwindow1


Maybe better to hand place due to texture shape, or highly likely to be used without light:
hereticwindow
lilwin02
stngls1 // better to hand place multiple colors?
stngls3 // better to hand place multiple colors?
stnglsmage // better to hand place multiple colors?
window031
bigwin02




HOW:
Create a light with the key|value's below, one light for each texture name.
This light will get copied and placed in front of
any face with that texture and duplicated every
128 units.


"_surface" "texturename"
Makes surfaces with the given texture name emit light, by using this light as a template which is copied across those surfaces. Lights are spaced about 128 units (though possibly closer due to bsp splitting) apart and positioned 2 units above the surfaces.

"_surface_offset" "n"
Controls the offset lights are placed above surfaces for "_surface". Default 2.

"_surface_spotlight" "n"
For a surface light template (i.e. a light with "_surface" set), setting this to "1" makes each instance into a spotlight, with the direction of light pointing along the surface normal. In other words, it automatically sets "mangle" on each of the generated lights.
