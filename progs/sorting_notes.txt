Model sorting into folders from each mod:
AD - In progress, last one done in code flame2.mdl
AD - Done all identical, need to address different between ad170 and ad171
Drake - Models put into folder, not fixed in code - lots of errors to be expected!!

Wizard, added green poison? skin from AD171...code it?
