Vortex by Preach (andrew.denner@btinternet.com)

This is a "special effects" model which looks like a sucking vortex of doom. 
It would be ideal for an level-end teleporter you want to make especially
obvious, and could also be used to create a whirlpool with the right skin.

The model comes with a single looping animation of the vortex in action,
plus four skins:

1: Purple Maelstrom
2: Teleporter Malfunction
3: Van de Graaff
4: Quicksand

This model would look very angular and wrong if you computed the vertex
normals in the usual way. So included with the model in this zip is the
python script I used to create it and all the source files. The batch file
included will build the model and run the python script, so long as you have
the following tools on your path:

a) md3tomdl (https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/md3tomdl/)
b) a version of python with the qmdl module installed
   (https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/qmdl/)

This is the recommened way to add extra skins to the model - add them to the
list of skins in model.py and re-run the batch file.
