<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>"deathtype" can now be set for any solid BSP entity that can damage
things. When a player is killed by the entity, the displayed obituary will
be the string entered for that entities deathtype.

<P><A NAME="gravity"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>"gravity" can now be set for monsters to set the initial amount of gravity
for them. This will allow for them to be started in an area of low gravity.
Please note that the gravity changing in Custents affects all things that
are affected by gravity, so if you have monsters in a large area that you
want to low gravity, you only need to set the monster's intiial gravity
and then have the triggers to change the gravity at all entrance locations
to that area.

<P><A NAME="killtarget"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Every entity that targets something can kill two targets using "killtarget"
and "killtarget2". They can be used in any order.

<P><A NAME="target"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Every entity that targets something can now target up to four different
targetnames using "target", "target2", "target3", and "target4". They can
be used in any order. Please note that this only works for triggering another
entity. For purposes like finding an entity to follow or some other purpose
like that, the first target name, "target" must still be used.

<P><A NAME="targetname"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Every entity that is targeted by something can have up to three different
targetnames using "targetname", "targetname2", "targetname3", and "targetname4".
They can be used in any order. Please note that some entities may require
using certain targetnames due to the fact that they do different things
when triggered by different names.
