<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_train (0 .5 .8) ? TRAIN_SMOOTH TRAIN_BLOCKABLE</B>
<UL>The train has been modified so that you have the option of making it
move smoothly. It also has several other added features to it. Here are
the new and changed values by func_trains.

<P><B>+ TRAIN_SMOOTH</B> Makes the train move smoothly through path_corners
that have no wait time on them.

<P><B>+ TRAIN_BLOCKABLE</B> Allows the smooth trains to be blocked in the
regular fasion of stopping and applying damage instead of pushing the blocking
entity out of the way like it would do otherwise.

<P><B>+ "duration"</B> specifies the amout of time for the train to take
in going from corner to corner. Set to 0 if you want to use "speed".

<P><B>+ "noise"</B> allows you the specify a wav file for the stop sound.

<P><B>+ "noise1"</B> allows you the specify a wav file for the moveing
sound.

<P><B>+ "count"</B> is the number of clones you want the train to make
of it self. The clones are placed sequentially along the path corners.It
is recomented to have a train make fewer than 10 clones of itself to ensure
that proper timing and spacing is maintained.

<P>All other standard train setup stuff still applies to the trains.</UL>
<A NAME="path_corner"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>path_corner (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL><B>+ "speed"</B> makes the train move on to the next corner at this
rate.

<P><B>+ "duration"</B> makes the train move on to the next corner and get
there in this number of seconds. If this is not 0, this will be used over
the speed variable.

<P><B>+ "event"</B> is the target name of the entity to trigger when the
train gets to it.

<P><B>+ "message"</B> is the message to display when the event is triggered.</UL>
<A NAME="func_train_syncer"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_train_syncer (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SYNCER_START_ON SYNCER_START_TOGETHER
SYNCER_RETRACTABLE SYNCER_BLOCKABLE SYNCER_SYNC_BLOCK</B>
<UL>This is an entity that is to be targeted at a set of trains and it
will keep these trains syncronized no matter how badly they get blocked
up. All settings for the trains are set in this entity and it passes them
down so that all the trains are all the same. Things like being invisible
or glowing are still set in the trains themselves, but can not be changed
during play. Really the only things that need to be set in the trains are
the target and target name. This entity will automatically make all controlled
trains into smooth trains, and duration must be used, not speed.

<P><B>SYNCER_START_ON</B> Makes the set of trains start out moving. This
is only needed if the syncer is targeted, otherwise it will automatically
start anyway.

<P><B>SYNCER_START_TOGETHER</B> All of the trains start at the same location.
This location is the first path_corner that the syncer goes to.

<P><B>SYNCER_RETRACTABLE</B> Makes the trains all go back together to the
same location when triggered off. This location is specified by the first
path_corner that the syncer goes to.

<P><B>SYNCER_BLOCKABLE</B> Allows the trains to actually be blocked by
things rather than trying to push the blocking object out of the way like
it does by default. This also allows blocking entities to be damaged by
the trains.

<P><B>SYNCER_SYNC_BLOCK</B> Forces all of the train that the syncer controls
to stop at the same time when any of them are blocked. If this is not set,
only the blocked train will stop. This does nothing if SYNCER_BLOCKABLE
is not set.

<P><B>"target"</B> is the name that all of the trains that will be controlled
by the syncer.

<P><B>"path"</B> is the name of the first path_corner that the syncer will
go to itself. This is also where the train set will go to if it starts
or retracts together.

<P><B>"duration"</B> is the amount of time that the trains will take to
travel from corner to corner.

<P><B>"dmg"</B> is the damage that will be given if SYNCER_BLOCKABLE is
set.</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_change_path"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_change_path (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL>The point entity trigger is used to alter a path. It changes the "target"
of the targeted path corner to acomplish this. It also alters the entity
link of the path which is used to speed up trains during the game compared
to repeted find functions.

<P><B>"targetname"</B> is its triggering name.

<P><B>"target"</B> is the name of the path corner to change the target
of.

<P><B>"path"</B> is the new destination path corner for the targeted path
corner.</UL>
