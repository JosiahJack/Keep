<BR><B>actor_stationary (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL>This is a powerfull actor entity that can perform two different actions
or be killed when triggered by one of it's targetnames, and has sound playing
support. This actor entity is stationary and is not solid. You don't have
to worry about what all the different setable values are unless you want
to make a new or special purpose actor because there are several preset
value sets that are selectable using the "impulse" value. The <A HREF="apoc.htm#actor impulse setups">list
of these impulses</A> is below. Any of these preset collections of settings
for the actors can be overridden just by setting the value on the actor.
To add your own preset value groups, add then to the actor_values_setup
function in the actors.qc file then recompile. To make the actor do the
first action, trigger it with its "targetname". To make it do its second
action, trigger it with its "targetname2". To make it die(which makes it
totally inactive) trigger it with its "targetname3". The value names would
be intuitive, but due to the number of values used by the actor entity,
I had to scroung up every entity data value I could find. If you're ever
wondering what a certain value does, please just look for it here to find
what it does. If it's not listed here, then that means it's not actually
a used value.

<P><B>"impulse"</B> is the number of the preset values set to use. There
several sets for some models to allow for different purposes. Any of the
values that are specifically set in the other values will override these
presets so that you can modify any of the preset values sets as needed.
Default is 0, which is the first player model values set.

the actor_path.

<P><B>AP_SETVARS</B> changes all the actors values to what was set on the

use the values for that impulse values set when it reaches there. For all
the different setable values, see the actor_moveable entry just below.

the previous actor_path. Set to -1 for warp.

<P><B>"angles"</B> the angles to set the actor to when it reaches the actor_path.

<UL>This is a powerfull actor entity that can perform two different actions,
be killed, or move when triggered by one of it's targetnames. It has sound
playing support during all its different actions. This actor entity is
moveable and is not solid. It usually moves at one of the two rates specified,
its walking rate, or its running rate. A travel time duration can be specified.
You don't have to worry about what all the different setable values are
unless you want to make a new or special purpose actor because there are
several preset value sets that are selectable using the "impulse" value.

its "targetname2". To make it die(which makes it totally inactive thereafter)
trigger it with its "targetname3". To make start moving from a stationary
position, trigger it with its "targetname4".

<P><B>ACTOR_ACTPAUSE</B> makes the actor pause it's movement to perform
its actions.

when it performs an action. It must be triggered with its "targetname4"
to make it move again.

flight paths for ships or making actors walk on walls and ceilings. If
not set, the actor will only adjust its yaw to face the direction that
it is heading.
