<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>&nbsp;info_player_start (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL>&nbsp;Has been modified slightly to allow for the use of multiple start
points within a level. This feature is only allowed in single player

<P><B>+ "weapon"</B> is its ID number for use with multiple starting points</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_changelevel"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>&nbsp;trigger_changelevel (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) INFO_RESET</B>
<UL>This trigger has been changed slightly to allow or multiple starting
points within the same level. This feature is only supported in single
player.

<P><B>+ INFO_RESET</B> resets all the between-level information for serverflags
(runes) and id#s for stored events. This should only be set if player is
moving off into another, unconnected level group. This will allow all serverflags
and id #s to be use again for the next level group.

<P><B>+ "weapon"</B> specifies the ID number of the info_player_start to
start the player at when going to the next level.</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_multiple"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_multiple (.5 .5 .5) ? NOTOUCH</B>
<UL>Variable sized repeatable trigger. Must be targeted at one or more
entities. If "health" is set, the trigger must be killed to activate each
time. If "delay" is set, the trigger waits some time after activating before
firing.

<P><B>NOTOUCH</B> doesn't trigger when it's touched, but has been obsoleted
by trigger_relay, so use a trigger_relay instead if you want this. (the
trigger_relay is a point entity too)

<P><B>"wait"</B> Seconds between triggerings. (.2 default)

<P><B>"cnt"</B> how many times it can be triggered (infinite default) If
notouch is set, the trigger is only fired by other entities, not by touching.

<P><B>"sounds"</B>
<UL>1 - secret
<BR>2 - beep beep
<BR>3 - large switch
<BR>4 - set "message" to text string</UL>
</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_hurt"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_hurt (.5 .5 .5) ?</B>
<UL>Any object touching this will be hurt.

<P><B>"dmg"</B> damage amount, defalt is 5.

<P><B>"cnt"</B> how many times to trigger. Default 0 (infinite)</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_monsterjump"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_monsterjump (.5 .5 .5) ?</B>
<UL>Walking monsters that touch this will jump in the direction of the
trigger's angle

<P><B>"speed"</B> default to 200, the speed thrown forward

<P><B>"height" </B>default to 200, the speed thrown upwards

<P><B>"cnt"</B> how many times to trigger. Default 0 (infinite)</UL>
&nbsp;<A NAME="func_door"></A>&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_door (0 .5 .8) ? START_OPEN UNUSED DONT_LINK GOLD_KEY SILVER_KEY
TOGGLE SMALL_TRIG</B>
<UL>I just added a small option to the doors that allow you to put them
in narrow hallways and small places without them opening while the player
is too far away or on the other side of a thin wall.

<P><B>+ SMALL_TRIG</B> makes the door spawn its touch trigger only 30 units
away, instead of 60. This is very usefull for when you have doors in small
places or near thin walls.</UL>
&nbsp;<A NAME="monster_ogre_marksman"></A>&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>monster_ogre_marksman (1 0 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32) Ambush</B>
<UL>I thought it weird to have a "marksman" be just as bad a shot as a
regular ogre, so I souped them up with better aim and the ability to fire
while on the run. They can close on you surprisingly fast, since they don't
have to stop to fire off a grenade at you. Definatly much more dangerous.
