<BR><B>trigger_impulse (0 0.5 0.8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL>This trigger uses its targets when the choosen impulse is pressed.
Any impulse from 1 to 255 can be used. It can be activated by a player
anywhere in the level.

<P><B>"impulse"</B> is the impulse value that will activate the trigger.

<P><B>"wait"</B> delay time till it can be used again after being activated.

<P><B>"message"</B> the message to print when a player touches the trigger.
This Should generally be used to tell the player which key to press to
activate the trigger.</UL>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_touch_impulse (0 0.5 0.8) ?</B>
<UL>This trigger uses its targets when the choosen impulse is press, but
only when the player is touching the trigger. Any impulse from 1-255 can
be used.

<P><B>"impulse"</B> is the impulse value that will activate the trigger.

<P><B>"message"</B> the message to print when a player touches the trigger.
This Should generally be used to tell the player which key to press to
activate the trigger.

<P><B>"wait"</B> delay time till it can be used again after being activated.</UL>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_interupt (0 0.5 0.8) ? INT_ENTIN INT_PLAYERONLY INT_MONSTONLY
INT_SETACTIVATOR</B>
<UL>This can be used to make sure that there is either noone or someone
in the trigger's area when the triggering is relayed. This can only be
used to control the relaying of a triggering, not to start one.

<P><B>INT_ENTIN</B> a player and/or monster must be IN it for it to relay
the triggering. Default is to relay when there are NO players and/or monsters
in it.

<P><B>INT_PLAYERONLY</B> makes it only check to see if a player is in it
and ignore monsters.

<P><B>INT_MONSTONLY</B> makes it only check to see if a monster is in it
and ignore players.

<P><B>INT_SETACTIVATOR</B> sets the last touched player within it to be
the activator of the triggering.

<P><B>"path"</B> is the name to trigger if the regular triggering chain
is interrupted.

<P><B>"sounds"</B> is the number of the sounds to use for when the triggering
chain is interupted.
<UL>
<LI>
1 = Base sound</LI>

<LI>
2 = Medieval sound</LI>

<LI>
3 = Runic sound</LI>
</UL>
<B>"noise"</B> is the actual sound file to play when the triggering chain
is interupted. Allows for using sounds other than those setable by "sounds".</UL>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_combo (0 0.5 0.8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) BIT1 BIT2 BIT3 BIT4</B>
<UL>This trigger requires a certain combination of targetname triggerings
to make it use its targets. The required combination is set using the spawnflags.

<P><B>BIT1 - BIT4</B> these spawnflags are used to set the combination
required to make it use its targets. Each of the spawnflag bits corrosponds
to the similarly numbered targetname. As an example, setting BIT1 and BIT3
require that its targetname and targetname3 be triggered for the correct
combination. Up to four different names can be used in the combo triggering.

<P><B>"noise"</B> is the sound to play when the correct combination is
entered.

<P><B>"noise1"</B> name to trigger when activated by its targetname.

<P><B>"noise2"</B> name to trigger when activated by its targetname2.

<P><B>"noise3"</B> name to trigger when activated by its targetname3.

<P><B>"noise4"</B> name to trigger when activated by its targetname4.</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_sequence"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_sequence (0 0.5 0.8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SEQ_FAILRESET SEQ_MULTIPLE</B>
<UL>This trigger requires an ordered sequence of triggering in order to
make it use its targets. This sequential order is determined by the targetnames,
which must be used in order (targetname, targetname2, etc.) and any number
of them can be used, so you can have sequences from one to four triggerings.

<P><B>SEQ_FAILRESET</B> makes the sequence reset back to the begining if
the proper sequence of triggerings is broken.

<P><B>SEQ_MULTIPLE</B> allows the sequence trigger to be used multiple
times. If not set, the trigger will remove itself after the first time
the sequence is properly entered.

<P><B>"targetname"</B> is the name of the first name that must be triggered
in the sequence.

<P><B>"targetname2"</B> is the name of the second name that must be triggered
in the sequence.

<P><B>"targetname3"</B> is the name of the third name that must be triggered
in the sequence.

<P><B>"targetname4"</B> is the name of the fourth name that must be triggered
in the sequence.

<P><B>"noise"</B> is the sound to play when the sequence is completed.

<P><B>"noise1"</B> is the sound to play when a correct triggering is made
in the sequence.

<P><B>"noise2"</B> is the sound to play when the sequence if broken.

<P><B>"event"</B> is the name to trigger if the sequence if broken by triggering
the targetnames out of teh correct order.</UL>
