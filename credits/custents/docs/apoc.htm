<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_particlespray (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)</B>
<UL>Shoots particles either when triggered, or contiuously when not triggered
by anything.

<P><B>"color"</B> is the palette color of the particles

<P><B>"count"</B> is the number of particles to make each time

<P><B>"delay"</B> is the delay between each triggering

<P><B>"noise"</B> is the name of the wav file to play when triggered

<P><B>"movedir"</B> is the vector distance that the particles will travel
before disappearing.

<P><B>"duration"</B> is the amount of time that the it will continue to
release particles so that it can release a long stream of particles with
only one triggering.</UL>
&nbsp;<A NAME="func_remote_cam"></A>&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_remote_cam (0 0.5 0.8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) RCAM_FREEZE RCAM_ALL
RCAM_TRACKING RCAM_SMOOTH RCAM_ALOWIMP RCAM_MOVING RCAM_EXITABLE RCAM_NODMG</B>
<UL>This is a camera usefull for mid level cutscenes and working security
cameras. It changes the player's view to the camera's when it is triggered.
The player must be the activator of the triggering for it to work properly.
The player's view angle's can be set to those of the camera with an optional
spawnflag. The view angle is always restored to its original value when
the camera is deactivated. The player's movement is always frozen while
in the camera view. For looped cameras, the player's pressing the fire
button will also make him trigger his current remote camera. This is what
allows the player to loop through all the different cameras.

<P><B>RCAM_FREEZE</B> forces the player to face in the direction of the
camera's angles at all times and does not allow then to look around. The
player's view direction is by default free to look around, but not if this
is set.

<P><B>RCAM_ALL</B> makes all player in the level use the camera when it
is triggered instead of just the player that activates the triggering.
Can be used in simgle player to activate a camera when the player was not
the activator of the triggering, allowing for several different triggering
possibilities.

<P><B>RCAM_TRACKING</B> makes the camera view track its "target" entity.
Allows panning scenes and turning security cameras. A good entity to use
for the target entity for panning shots is the func_moving_light.

<P><B>RCAM_SMOOTH</B> makes the camera tracking smoother, but at the cost
of doubling the number of calculation per second that it must do. Don't
bother using if doing still or slow panning scenes.

<P><B>RCAM_ALOWIMP</B> allows the player to use impulses to activate trigger_impulse
entities. Should allow for things like interactive cut scenes in mid-level.
Does not enable any other impulse actions like weapons fire or weapon selection.

<P><B>RCAM_MOVING</B> makes the camera move along with the entity named
in its "path" variable. It follows the target entities origin offset by
"pos1".

<P><B>RCAM_EXITABLE </B>allows players to exit the remote camera view by
pressing the fire button. This has no effect for a camera that's in a loop
since the player must press the button to switch between the different
cameras.

<P><B>"model" </B>is the model that the camera will be set to use. The
camera defaults to using no model.

<P><B>"target"</B> is the entity that the camera will point at. If not
used, then the camera's angles value is used.

<P><B>"angles" </B>sets the view angle of the camera if there is no "target"
specified.

<P><B>"spawnmodel"</B> allows you to specify a weaponmodel to use. Doing
this will allow for adding in things like monitor frames to make it appear
that the player is looking at a computer monitor. If a "spawnmodel" is
not specified, then no weaponmodel is displayed at all.

<P><B>"path"</B> is the name of the entity to move along with. RCAM_MOVING
must also be set for this to work.

<P><B>"pos1"</B> is used while moving with another entity. It is the offset
that the camera will be at relative to the other entity's origin. If set
to '-1 -1 -1', it will be automatically calculated from the camera's starting
position relative to the "path" entity's starting position. This allows
for visual placement of the camera.

<P><B>"target2"</B> is not to be confused with "target". "target2" is used
to specify that the camera is in a loop, and also the name of the next
camera in that loop. This should be set to the "targetname" of the next
camera in the loop for it to work properly. To designate the last camera
in the loop, set this to "end". This will make the player exit the camera
loop after pressing the fire button while using this last camera.

<P><B>"message"</B> is the message to display to the player when he uses
the camera.</UL>
<A NAME="func_glass"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_glass (0 .5 .8) ? GLASS_SMOOTH</B> <B>GLASS_BLOCKABLE</B> <B>GLASS_STARTOFF
GLASS_ONEHIT</B>
<UL>This entity can move in one of two ways. First, if its "target" key
is set, then it will move like a train. Second, if no "target"is specified,
it will move like a func_togglewall and toggle between being there and
not being there when triggered. All keys not described here are those of
it's movement which will be just like either a train or togglewall.

<P><B>GLASS_SMOOTH</B> is used when it moves like a train. This makes it
move like a smooth train instead of a regular train.

<P><B>GLASS_BLOCKABLE</B> is used when it moves like a train. This makes
it blockable when it's a smooth train.

<P><B>GLASS_STARTOFF</B> is used for when it is moving like a func_togglewall.
This makes it start in the off position so that it is not there when the
level begins.

<P><B>GLASS_ONEHIT</B> is for when the glass is destroyable. It makes it
like a trigger_damage threshold in that it requires a single hit of "health"
damage to destroy it. Damage taken is not acumulated.

<P><B>"health"</B> when set, the glass is destroyable and requires this
amount of damage to destroy. The "event" will be triggered when the func_glass
is destroyed.

<P><B>"color"</B> is the number of shards of glass to throw out when it
is destroyed. The default number is set according to the size of the entity's
brush model. Set this to -1 to make no pieces come out at all when it is
destroyed. I would have used "count" for this like the rubble throwers
do, but it's used for making clones when the glass entity is moving like
a train. Yes, glass supports cloning too. :)

<P><B>"event"</B> is the targetname to trigger when the func_glass is destroyed.

<P><B>"noise2"</B> is the sound to play when it is destryoed. This defaults
to a glass shattering sound.</UL>
<A NAME="func_model"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_model (0 .5 .8) ? ANIMATED STILLSTART</B>
<UL>This entity is to be used for placing static models that don't really
do anything but look nice. It has support for toggelable animation. Triggering
an animating one will make it toggle its animation on and off. A more effeciant
way to animate a model, though, is to not use this entities animation feature,
but instead use a model that has a scene grouped together starting at frame
0 so that Quake will animate it automatically in the Client's side. This
second method only allows for a 0.1 wait between frames and it has to start
at frame 0, but it's also much faster. Good examples of this method are
the flame.mdl and flame2.mdl included with Quake.

<P><B>ANIMATED</B> makes it animate through a few specified frames.

<P><B>STILLSTART</B> will make an animating one start with its animation
off.

<P><B>"model"</B> is the file name of the model to use. This can be either
an actual model, or a sprite.

<P><B>"angles"</B> specified the pitch, yaw, and roll to place the model
with.

<P><B>"wait"</B> is the delay between the different frames when being animated.
Default value is 0.1.

<P><B>"walkframe"</B> is the number of the first frame to start animating
at. Default is 0.

<P><B>"count"</B> is the number of frames to animate through. Default is
2.

<P><B>"weaponframe"</B> is the frame number to use when not animating.
If this is not set, it will just stay with the frame that it was using
when it was triggered to stop. To use frame 0 as the still frame, set this
to - 1.</UL>
<A NAME="trigger_servomech"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>trigger_servomech (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SITTING NODMG</B>
<UL>This is the point entity to use to target the func_servomech controllable
mechs. It can be used to target as many as you want. They will be used
in the order that they are added to the map. This entity must be triggered
by another entity, as this just relays the command for control to the appropriate
servomech. Several of these can target the same group of servomechs, they
will just assign the first available servomech to the player when activated.
They are usually best triggered by a trigger_impulse.

<P><B>SITTING</B> makes the player appear to be sitting while using the
servomech. (currently makes the player stand with a gun instead of an axe)

<P><B>NODMG</B> makes the player impervious to damage while using this
trigger_servomech.

<P><B>"target"</B> is the "target" value assigned to all the servomechs
that are accessable through this trigger_servomech.</UL>
<A NAME="func_servomech"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>func_servomech (0 .5 .8) (-32 -32 -48) (32 32 28)</B>
<UL>This makes a servomech that is player controllable. It must targeted
by a trigger_servomech to do this. It can also be placed simply as a stationary
servomech that can be shot up by just giving it no targetname.

<P><B>"targetname"</B> is what must be used to specify the name for it
to be targeted by. You can not use any of the other targetname variables.

<P><B>"skin"</B> sets the skin to use for the servomech.</UL>
<A NAME="monster_servomech"></A>

SPAWN_SLEEPING SPAWN_DEAD</B>
<UL>A dead body state has been added to the zombie to do two things. First
to increase the paranoia factor from the zombies, cause it's really hard
to tell when they're really dead. Second, to make it easier for Zombie
Masters to get their hands on the zombies. >) These are the type of zombies
that the Zombie Masters make. They can only be killed by either a direct
rocket blast or a hit from an ax.

<P><B>SPAWN_SLEEPING </B>makes the zombie start out lying down and asleep.
It will get up and attack if the player gets near it.

<P><B>SPAWN_DEAD </B>makes the zombie start lying down and escentially
dead. It will be changed to a sleeping state when triggered so that it
can come to life.</UL>

TUR_OFFRET TUR_LASERS TUR_ROCKETS TUR_PPC</B>
<UL>This is the ceiling mounted, automated gun turret. It can be placed
any distance under the surface that it will attach to. At the start of
the level, the turrets will adjust their vertical positioning so that they
are properly positioned up against the ceiling surface. When targeted,
turrets toggle between active and inactive. While inactive, a turret will
not react to anything. While active, the turret operates normally. The
defauly ammunition that the turrets fire is plasma bullets.

<P><B>TUR_STARTOFF </B>makes the turret start out as inactive.

<P><B>TUR_RETRACT </B>makes the turret retract up into the ceiling when
it is inactive and when it currently has no target.

<P><B>TUR_OFFRET </B>makes the turret retract into the ceiling only when
it is inactive. It remain as normal when it has no enemy.

<P><B>TUR_LASERS </B>makes the turret fire lasers.

<P><B>TUR_ROCKETS </B>makes the turret fire rockets.

<P><B>TUR_PPC </B>makes the turret fire a phased plasma cannon.

<P><B>"health" </B>is the amount of health that the turret will have. Default
is 100.

<P><B>"rotate_type" </B>is the starting tile angle of the gun. Default
is 0, which is in a horizontal position. Valid values are from 0 to 90.

<UL>A modified version of the regular Enforcer. Looks really cool and fires
a double laser in a semi-random speed tracking way that makes it extreamly
hard to predict just where he's firing, and so it's much more difficult
to dodge these guys' weapons fire.</UL>
<A NAME="weapon_ppc"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><B>weapon_ppc (0 0 1) (-16 -16 0, 16 16 32)</B>
<UL>This the pickupable Phased Plasma Cannon. It's been modified from it's
original form so that it doesn't require as much added stuff (like 5 extra
skins for everything) and so that is't a bit more of an interesting weapon.
Both its power and ammo usage depend apon the total amount of ammo (cells)
that you have. The more ammo you've got, the bigger, longer, and more destructive
the bursts that you fire out. To simplify the coding for it even more,
I've removed the added death required for it. Personally, I think it actualyl
looked even cooler now, cause there's bloody chunks flying everywhere now.
:) It's been added in a way that if you don't want it in your game, just
don't use it. Even if the player does an Impulse 9, he can't use it unless
he knows what impulse you set it on (199). Anyway, try it out to see how
you like it. ;)</UL>
