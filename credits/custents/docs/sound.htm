<UL><B>"speed"</B> specifies the annotation of the ambient sound. -1 is
for none, 1 is for normal, 2 is for idle, and 3 is for static. This defaults
to 1.

<P><B>"volume"</B> is the volume at which to play the ambient sound. Default
is 1.

sound</UL>

<BR><B>ambient_bgm (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) BGM_START_ON</B>
<UL>This was first only intended for background music, but the addition
of being able the specify the volume and annotation make it much more versitile
and usefull.

<P><B>BGM_START_ON</B> it starts the level playing and does not wait to
be triggered. This is not needed if it does not have a target name, because
it will start anyway.

<P><B>"noise1"</B> is the file name for the intro. This is not required.

<P><B>"button1"</B> is the length of the intro wav file. It should be exact
to the hundredths place for a more seemless transition from the intro the
the main loop. This is not needed unless there is an intro wav to play.

<P><B>"noise2"</B> is the file name for the main loop wav file. This is
a required thing for this to work.

<P><B>"button2"</B> if the length of the main loop wav file. It should
be exact to the hundreths place for a more seemless transition from loop
to loop, or loop to entro. This is not required if the loop is going to
be played only once and there is no extro wav to play.

<P><B>"waitmax"</B> is the number of times that the main loop wav will
be played before automatically stopping. It will loop infinitly if this
is set to 0.

<P><B>"noise3"</B> is the file name for the extro wav file. This is not
required.

<P><B>"button0"</B> is the length of the extro wav file. It is only needed
if something will be traggered when playing stops. It is to be set to the
amount of time that you want to delay the triggering after the start of
the extro wav file. In other words, it can be longer of shorter than the
actual wav to suit your needs.

<P><B>"target"</B> is the entity to trigger when play has stopped. It will
be be delayed button0 seconds after the extro wav is started. An extro
wav file is not required to trigger an entity after play has stopped, and
button0 can still be used to delay the triggering.

<P><B>"speed"</B> specifies the annotation of the ambient sound. -1 is
for none, 1 is for normal, 2 is for idle, and 3 is for static. This defaults
to 1.

<P><B>"volume"</B> is the volume at which to play the ambient sound. Default
is 1.</UL>
