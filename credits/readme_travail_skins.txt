Hi-res travail skins
************************

From the pen of aguirRe:

"I uploaded some external skins for the travail custom monsters for Jack [scragbait], maybe you're interested in checking them out as well? They are based on the original 8-bit skins and then just filtered a bit to bring out more details and colours."

- These skins in both .jpg and .tga are included in the .zip file.

- Put them in directory "textures/models" beneath "travail".

Also from aguirRe:

"Then add gl_exttex 1 to your autoexec.cfg file and start any of my GL-exgines. Since my file only adds the Travail-specific skins, you may want to copy the skins that ijed put into Warp also in the same dir (avoid overwriting). Then all the std monsters will also have better skins."

- But don't use the player skin or the teleport skin... these are warpspasm specific!

Further from the man:

"If you're unsure if the skins are loaded from the external tgas, change the value of gl_exttex to 2 and restart engine. If the textures are loaded externally, they'll be bright white now. The skins will also work in JoeQuake, as that's the default style for my engines."

...a word from distrans, and he alone:

The archenid skins are modifications to skins created originally by Ken Turner and later modified by Stan C, both long before Quake was GPL'd. Preach "scaried" them up for the travail mod and now aguirRe has sharpened them. The model is all Ken Turner's work and is not derived from any of the original Quake bestiary. The code driving the archenid is a conglomeration of efforts by Ken Turner, Stan C. and Preach/Asaki. Don't assume that the travail team hasn't made every effort to contact the original builders in an effort to gain their permission to GPL their work. Use these skins in a GPL'd project if you wish, but only if you are willing to state clearly and openly that you do so without the original author's permission and against the express desires of the travail project lead. There are alternatives in anomolous instances.
