-=> INTRODUCTION <=-

 Racing games have been among the most popular gaming genres
 since the early days of computer entertainment. From 'Pole Position'
 on the original Atari consoles right through to the state-of-art
 Sega arcade racers like 'Scud Race', gamers have been drawn to
 the adrenaline pumping exhileration proved by racing at break-
 neck speed where every split-second reaction can mean the difference
 between winning and losing. There is only ever one winner.

 Quake Rally uses id Software's first-person action game, 'Quake',
 as the basis of some brain-shaking racing and destruction. So
 slap on a helmet, strap on your seat-belt and GOOOOOOOOO....

 Quake Rally offers the whole range of vehicle based gaming
 experiences; from racing with and without weapons, through a variety of
 non-racing styles, right through to the story based single player
 challege of 'Cult'. While the main focus is largely in multiplayer
 gaming (up to 8 players), single players aren't left out.

 Please note that some of the documented features, such as bots and
 certain map types, are not in the intitial Quake Rally release and
 will appear in later revisions.

-=> Overview <=-

 Quake Rally is unlike any other racing game, but then no other
 racing game was built around Quake. Quake's ability to be
 molded and shaped into a variety of play styles is really
 quite remarkable, although it's fair to say that a 'racing game'
 was possibly never even considered and so QR plays differently
 than regular racing games.

 Steering is the biggest learning hurdle to transverse, although
 once the concept is grasped, and you've put in some driving time
 behind the wheel, the steering system allows an amount of
 flexibility and control unmatched using regular methods.

 Steering:-

        By steering left or right, either by mouse or keys, you
        are not directly affecting the car, you are instead changing
        the camera view in relation to the vehicle. The driver of
        the car then corrects the steering to drive in the direction
        pointed at by the camera, so if the car slides out due to
        a sharp turn, the driver corrects himself.

        The difference is subtle, but can feel a bit unusual to new
        drivers. If you have the steering wheel turned on, you
        can watch what the driver is doing in relation to your
        moves. The 'in car' view doesn't use this method - instead
        using a more traditional steering system - but as a result
        it is virtually unusable in multiplayer games, and doesn't
        work in recorded demos.

        The QR driving code allows quite a high degree of tailoring
        the view and play style to individual preference and so it's
        worth sitting down early on and finding the view, distance
        and 'camera sway' that most suits your play style. You may even
        find you use a different setup for different maps.

        There are 3 distinct view types; near, far and incar. 'Near'
        provides what is probably the "classic" view for a racing
        game with the view focusing largely on the car and the road
        immediately around it. 'Far' is similar except that the focus
        is more on the road ahead than the car. 'Incar' gives a drivers
        eye view of the track which means if the car rolls, so do you
        (hence the need for a seat-belt). The In-Car ciew is only
        available in single player mode.

        'Camera sway' varies how much the car swings to the side on
        a heavy corner relative to the camera view. There are 4 settings
        ranging from the "classic" tight style which keeps the car
        centered (F8), through varying degrees of looseness. The looser
        styles give the impression of a more "rally" style of gameplay
        but has the drawback on making it more difficult to line
        up with gates and kangaroos. The choice is yours.

        Quake Rally's driving code is unique in that it carefully
        blends together the best features of traditional racing games
        with the intense skill-based reactional gameplay of Quake.
        It's quite friendly to the driver allowing well controlled
        'donuts', spins and slides resulting in more of an "arcade"
        gaming feel than a pure simulation approach.

 Keys/Impulses:-

        Quake Rally uses a large number of new impulses and keys
        to take full advantage of the driving simulation's flexibility.
        Many aren't necessary to play the game so you can jump
        straight into the action without worrying about what new
        keys you need.

        CONTROL         KEYS                     CONSOLE/IMPULSE

 Weapons:-

        QR uses a mix of classic Quake weapons plus some slightly
        tweaked variants alongside a couple of new selections.

        WEAPON       KEY  NOTES
        ------       ---  -----
        None          1   Weapons in QR are visible to the other
                          players, so a switch to 'no weapon' can
                          be a good ambush tactic. "come get me,
                          I'm unarmed.. honest!".
        Repulsor      2   A non-rechargable electric bar which
                          surrounds the car protecting it from
                          bump damange and giving 4x the damage
                          to things you hit.
        Sprazer       3   A spread of bouncing lazer fire. Power and
                          accuracy is lost with distance so it's best
                          used close to the victim(s).
        SuperNailGun  4   The main QR weapon gives a good spray
                          at a distance, and a strong focused
                          burst close in.
        Detonator     5   A vertically firing weapon, they keep
                          anyone driving behind you on their toes.
                          Apon touching a car, they attach to the
                          chassis, prime themselves, then explode
                          5 seconds later. A detonator can be
                          disarmed by turning them on their side
                          (ie. roll the car).
        Mine          6   A black spiked ball which explodes at
                          the slightest touch. It fires in a "lob"
                          motion so the skill is to have it land
                          on your prey. Mines stay active for 3
                          seconds. They have the habit of occasionally
                          splitting into 3 shortly after launch.
        Rockets       7   The power weapon of QR, these rockets have
                          the benefit of homing into prey by use of
                          a motion detection system. They can be
                          fooled by moving aside at the last minute,
                          allowing them to pass you, and then by coming
                          to a quick halt they can't find you.

 Vehicles:-

        Supplied for your driving pleasure is a range of 7 handcrafted
        vehicles of the four-wheel persuasion. All cars in Quake Rally
        control identically, so you can base your choice on style and
        stature rather than trying to work out which one is best for
        each map.

                Stock Car       - 408 polygons
                Commodore       - 408 polygons
                Magna           - 346 polygons
                BMW Z3          - 346 polygons
                4WD Hatchback   - 325 polygons
                Triton          - 296 polygons
                Hilux           - 296 polygons

 Command Line Arguments:-

        Quake Rally can be started from the 'qrally.exe' front-end
        program, or via the command line ala Quake. There are some
        arguments available via the command line option which relate
        to Quake Rally in some way:

        +teamplay 11/12/13  - force a game type for a particular map
                              instead of using the type present in the
                              maps QR entity.

                              teamplay 11 = force racing without weapons
                              teamplay 12 = force racing with weapons
                              teamplay 13 = force pure deathmatch

        +map <name>         - load up a particular map
        -particles 0-90000  - set the maximum number of particles the
                              engine will draw. Default is 2048, so by
                              setting it to 0 you can potentially speed
                              the game up (QR tends to spray lots of
                              particles around).

-=> QUICK START <=-

        Rather than reading through pages of boring documentation first,
        you can jump straight into Quake Rally by:

        a) unZIPping the archive into your /Quake/ directory. Remember
           to keep the paths intact when extracting.

        b) run the 'qrally.exe' file which will now be in the Quake
           directory. This is a little front-end for the program which
           makes things easier. It assumes that you have all the QR
           stuff unarchived into /quake/rally.

        c) accept all defaults and click on GO. You'll now be in the
           start map, so drive around and find that 'Time Trial' entrance..

-=> GAME BASICS <=-

 Single Player:-

        In single player mode, QR opens in the 'start' map which gives
        access to various warpers (finding the warpers is part of the
        fun, and also gives you a chance to get used to the controls).

        You can use the QR "frontend" to start Quake Rally in single
        player mode or use a Quake-like command line like:

            quake -game rally +map qrstart

        The "front end" launcher is the preferred method of running
        Quake Rally, and must be used if you want to set the config
        file properly. Many of the settings are the same as Quake
        while others are specific to Quake Rally (the QR ones are
        covered throughout this documentation).

        There are 3 options available to a single player; 'Time Trial',
        'Time Trial: The Nighttime Nightmare' and 'Practice'.

    TIME TRIAL
    ----------

      The Time Trial provides a familar 'Sega Rally' gameplay
      variant with progression to the next track only being
      granted as you "win" the current one. To win a map requires
      beating the time limit to each check-point over a
      number of laps. Some maps also support bots to race against.

      The Time Trial game comes in two flavours: regular and
      nightmare. Regular Time Trial (the left hand warper) is
      played in a daylight setting whereas the Nighttime Nightmare
      is played at midnight so you have just your headlights to
      navigate the tracks.

      (note: headlights are particularly processor intensive so
             a fast machine is required for optimal speed)

      If you manage to complete all 4 maps, you come up against
      the grand finale "story map", CULT.

    -- CULT: THE ABANDONED FARMYARD --

       (Note: Cult requires a fairly decent PC system to get full
              speed out of - sorry)

    Long time annoyed at being dethroned as king of the first-person
    gaming genre, Duke Nukem took refuge in an abandoned farmyard
    deep in the Australian outback. Over the period of a year, Duke
    collected together like-minded comrades from around the world
    to form the 'Duke Cult' - their intention was to somehow take
    revenge on the Quake soldiers of the world, and regain the
    position he should never have lost. They devised a cunning plan..

    The cults solution was simple; resurrect the first episode
    Quake boss. The giant red demon was the only beast to really
    bring fear to the hearts of Quake soldiers, yet this time around
    they would need to be careful not to place him near any
    electrical equipment..

    The plan was perfect. As a cult, and being a game plot, they were
    easily able to summon the demon back into living form - located
    this time in a much safer place - then they would lay low long
    enough to allow the demon to regain the strength he lost
    being motionless in the death void for a year. *cue spooky music*

    --

    Quake Headquarters operatives become aware of Duke's hideous
    plans after hearing bizarre stories about kangaroo populations
    in central Australia dropping considerably. There had also been
    numerous sightings of "an obnoxious blond guy" in the otherwise
    quiet outback towns. Reconnaissance proved the fears of an
    attempted Duke revival to be true!

    Time was of uttermost importance - whatever the cult's plan was,
    there was no way to tell how far evolved it was. With just
    5 specialised Quake Soldiers stationed across outback Australia,
    the mission was going to be a tough one. The soldiers were
    oredered to immediately travel to the abandoned farmyard and
    engage the enemy on arrival.

    Intelligence showed 20 cult members stationed at the farm,
    although it was impossible to identify which member was Duke
    himself. The mission: arrest Duke at all costs.

    -- END CULT PLOT --

      In gaming terms, you have to arrest Duke Nukem, but if that
      comes down to having to kill all 20 cult members
      then so be it..

      If you shoot a kangaroo (don't do this at home kids.. go
      to your neighbours place instead) he drops a supply of ammo
      for the nail gun. If you can drive over the roos instead,
      you'll not only get the nails, but a BONUS; 3 extra rockets,
      invulnerability for 30 seconds or super-traction.

      Quake HQ are not exactly sure how the roos came into
      possession of such items, but the current theory suggests
      alien involvement with links to cattle mutilation..

      Hint: don't let them Dukes get the missile launcher if you
            can help it, or you'll be sooorry.

    PRACTICE
    --------

      The 'start' map provides a good opportunity to learn the
      controls, but in the practice area you can go straight
      to any of the Quake Rally maps for some carefree driving.
      You do need to learn the maps or you won't stand a chance
      against seasoned players.

      If you find yourself getting a bit lost, each map comes with
      a small demo lap which can be played by bringing down the
      console and typing 'playdemo {mapname}'. For example:

          playdemo qrally03

 Multiplayer:-

      Quake Rally supports up to 8 players with the server cycling
      through the multiplayer maps. Each racing map starts with a 10
      second pause which gives time for new players to join in the
      game. Players joining mid-game go into "observer mode" which
      allows them to view the race from pre-positioned cameras
      although they can't take part in the current map. During the
      pause, players can choose vehicles, colours and read the aim
      of the map about to be played. Once the player has started their
      engine, they cannot change vehicles.

      There are three map types in Quake Rally (two map types had to
      be dropped for lack of maps), each giving a slightly different
      style of gameplay. Racing maps are based on a set number of laps
      and once one player finishes the race the other players are given
      just 30 more seconds to finish the race before the map is finished.
      First, second and third place get trophies. w00!

      Non-racing maps require the server to set the TIMELIMIT console
      variable for the maps to cycle correctly. This works the same as
      normal quake, the map will end after the TIMIELIMIT value has been
      elapsed in minutes.

      The 3 map types are:

      Pure Racing
      -----------

        Pure racing maps are long circuits with the aim being
        simply to be the first driver to do the required number
        of laps. No weapons are present, but often health supplies
        are dotted around to counter the constant beating the
        cars take.

      Pure Deathmatch
      ---------------

        Enclosed arena areas with lots of weapons and no circuit
        to worry about. The aim is to destroy other cars.

     Racing+Dealthmatch
     ------------------

        Finely balanced, and somewhat "open" circuit tracks
        which allow for both circuit racing and weapon based
        ass-kicking. Bonus points are awarded for passing
        through all checkpoints in the map, but it's not
        that easy if the cars behind you have weapons..

  The Maps:-

        The Multiplayer side of Quake Rally contains several maps
        designed to be played on cycle, although they can all be
        played individually if prefered. At the start of each racing
        map, there is a 10 second wait allowing other people to join
        in or leave and to get a quick brief on the aim of the map.

        The maps, in order of play, are:

                 1.  qrally01     - The Franklin Project
                 2.  qrdm03       - Downtown
                 3.  qrally02     - Mining Station
                 4.  qrdm01       - The Bowl
                 5.  qrally03     - Chasm
                 6.  qrdm04       - Cliffside Carnage 3
                 7.  qrdm02       - Interstate 95
                 8.  qrally04     - Industrial Wastelands

     1. qrally01 - The Franklin Project
                 - Pure Racing

                 Is located around a valley being made ready for
                 damming. The contractors have all pulled out
                 leaving the perfect environment for some rally
                 action.

     2. qrdm03   - Downtown
                 - Pure Deathmatch

                 A small enclosed city area ripe with weapons and ammo.
                 The missile launcher is in an easy to reach location,
                 although you open yourself up to attack; how bad do you
                 want it. HUH?

     3. qrally02 - Mining Station
                 - Racing + Deathmatch

                 A futuristic city on an industrialized asteroid
                 being mined for minerals. Large tunnels that have been
                 drilled clean through large areas of rock were
                 later used as roads connecting the various bases.
                 To get the weapons on this map requires some
                 skillfull driving if you are to keep up with the
                 pack, and be careful around the angled ground.

     4. qrdm01   - The Bowl
                 - Pure Deathmatch

                 Somewhere, dug deep into the desert, this basin
                 of carnage plays host to one of the messiest
                 car based sports in history. Weapons and ammo
                 aplenty adorn this large area of angles, ramps
                 and tunnels where staying alive is just as
                 important as killing.

     5. qrally03 - Chasm
                 - Pure Racing

                 This old coal mine, recently abandoned due to
                 volcanic activity, is one of the toughest
                 driving tracks of the set. Careful timing of
                 every move and turn you make is vitally important
                 if you hope to cross the finish line first.

     6. qrdm04   - Cliffside Carnage 3
                 - Pure Deathmatch

                 A DM map set around a rugged mountain circuit,
                 with a brief view of the waterfront. U-turning out
                 of trouble is difficult under these conditions,
                 so watch out.

     7. qrdm02   - Interstate 95
                 - Pure Deathmatch

                 A scenic ocean view and lush countryside provide
                 the perfect setting for fast deathmatching action.
                 Suspension gets a full workout which some large
                 jumps scattered around.

     8. qrally04 - Industrial Wastelands (coming soon!)
                 - Pure Racing

                 The heavily industrialised backlot of an old
                 pioneer township provides the backdrop for high
                 speed racing action. There's some tricky areas
                 to negotiate (yes, you might need to ease off
                 on the acceleration from time to time) and
                 the night setting may make vision difficult.
                 We'd like to apologize to MUMS Freighting for
                 any damage caused.

  Server/client Setup:-

        Normal Quake (and our previous project, Quess) can be played using
        either -listen or -dedicated servers, but it's important to note that
        in multiplayer play with more than 2 cars, Quake Rally almost
        certainly requires it's own -dedicated server. But by all means,
        feel free to try it if in doubt..

        Multiplayer games are initiated by first starting a machine as the
        server:

      Via Launcher

        Quake Rally comes complete with a "front end" launcher program
        which aids immensely in setting up both multiplayer and single
        player games, and dealing with all the hotkeys and setting that
        Quake Rally used. This launcher is Win95 specific, and is fairly
        self-explanatory.

        Using the launcher is the preferred means of starting a game of
        Quake Rally (at any level) because it writes out a config file.
        Once the config file is setup, QR can be started from a DOS shell
        and it will use the correct config settings.

        The launcher can be found in the quake directory; just double
        click on the file named 'qrally.exe'.

      Via Command Line

          winquake -game rally -dedicated 8 +map qrally01 (prefered)
          winquake -game rally -listen 2 +map qrally01    (good luck)

        QR allows a maximum of 8 players. Once the server is running, people
        can join with:

            winquake -game rally +connect *.*.*.*

        The *.*.*.* is where you type in the IP address of the server which
        was started in the previous step. The server might be a LAN machine
        name or a full IP number/address located on the internet somewhere.

        These examples use winquake for simplicity (you could use any
        networkable version of Quake) and show the command line way of
        running it - if you use the QR "frontend" program then everything
        can be setup with simple mouse clicks.

-=> QUAKE RALLY TECH STUFF <=-

        Quake Rally was created by modifying Quake, and to a slightly
        lesser extent you can even produce mods for Quake Rally.

        Map design in QR tends to play a MUCH larger part in directly
        affecting gameplay than in Quake. In QR, every angle, distance
        and width directly affects how the car controls, and how a group
        of cars will be work when driving through areas together.
        Examining the maps present in the QR package will show exactly
        what ideas work best (and probably point out some things which
        don't work quite so well).

        Brushes:-

           One important thing to remember when creating QR maps is
           to avoid using angles of more than around 30 degrees for
           any large distance (ie. the car doesn't like travelling up
           sharp angles). Angle changes also work a lot better if the
           change is progressive rather than, for example, going
           straight from flat to 30 degrees.

           The car sizes in QR are quite small in relation to Quake's
           scale (cars are around half as tall as the Quake player)
           so the surroundings need to be scaled down appropriately.
           The relative scale of the surroundings is also largely
           dependent on how close to the car the camera is; with
           the camera in close everything looks quite large, but if
           you zoom out you'll see the car is actually quite small.

           QR is actually doing many more calculations per frame
           for each car as compared to the Quake player, and so
           to compensate the slowdown, r_speeds (or r_numsurf) needs
           to be somewhat lower than Quake. Quake averages around 450,
           and so we aimed for maxes of around 400 for maps that
           would have multiple players plus weapons. Since some
           of QR's maps are devoid of weaponry, we could actually
           be quite a bit more relaxed on this figure for those maps.

           The cars work a LOT better in wide open areas as opposed
           to tight corridors so build everything big. Remember
           there could be a max of 8 cars racing around so allow
           plenty of room (although occasional tight spots are good
           to make being in the lead that much more important).
           Cluttered landscapes are annoying too, so a simple yet
           elegant design in maps is recommended. Always try to
           find a balance between requiring skill and having fun.

           It's also important to avoid using low sloped roofs which
           would touch the bounding box of a car because the car doesn't
           like it (possibly the car is ticklish, although no studies
           have been done).

           Included on the Quake Rally web page, and not as part of
           the main distribution, is the qrally.wad file containing
           all the new textures created for Quake Rally. You are free
           to make use of these textures so long as they are ONLY
           used for Quake Rally maps, and that they are not included
           on any CD-Roms. You should also make these clear in the
           readme file if you have made use of these textures.
           Check out the copyright section of this documentation for the
           formal rules.

           Cars that touch lava die instantly, and if they become
           -fully- submerged in water the same fate awaits them. Shallow
           water hazards only cause a slight slow down.

        Entities:-

           There are quite a few special entities for Quake Rally;
           some represent physical objects like barracades, and others
           are for the circuit setup itself.

           See the separate file 'QRentities.htm' for a full list.
           The information present in that .htm file is as easy to
           understand as we could make it so emailing us asking how
           the entities work is unlikely to provide any answers.

-=> IN DEPTH <=-

        From humble beginnings - an experiment in 3D mathematics - Quake
        Rally turned into the mother of all projects. Not because of
        the size of the project - other Quake conversions like Shrak
        probably have more work - but because the Quake engine was
        not designed with racing games in mind and so Quake Rally was
        a journey into new territory.

        Quake Rally cannot compete with commercial games of the same genre
        nor was it designed to do so. In using Quake as the basis for
        the game, there were several rather major drawbacks which
        restricted QR from being a serious threat to commercial games,
        but by the same token, Quake technology has MANY benefits
        which we were able to make use of. Hopefully the benefits
        have outweighed any shortfalls, and at the very least, QR
        is rather unique entry in the racing genre.

        The drawbacks were things like non-rotating bounding boxes
        (which limits angles the car can drive on before looking
        funny, and also causes the car to stick into walls), through to
        limitations in map sizes and polygon count (the latter being
        more a problem of machine power rather than Quake itself).

        The benefits of using Quake's engine were numerous, including
        having probably the best multiplayer code built into the system,
        and things like the great tried-and-tested weapons base to
        work from.

        If we were to start again right now and redo the whole thing from
        scratch with the knowledge and experience we've gained in
        the last 7 months, we could quite easily make it at least
        five times better. And once Quake2 technology is released,
        we may just do that.

-=> QUAKE RALLY FAQ <=-

 Q: Why can't you run around as the Quake guy then jump into the cars?
 A: There are a few reasons for this, but the main reason is that QR
    from the start was designed to be vehicular gaming only, and would
    now require a major rewrite to accomodate two completely different
    main-player control types.

 Q: Why do all the cars handle identically?
 A: The reasoning behind the varied vehicles was purely for variety so that
    everyone would be happy choosing a different car from one another
    rather than choosing the one that works best on each level, much
    like the skins in QuakeWorld add variety and a sense of personality.
    Also, the amount of testing involved would have been way out of
    hand for what was supposed to be a "simple" project. And besides,
    it's often more annoying having to choose between 'good-speed/bad-
    handling' and 'bad-speed/good-handling' when you really want both
    to be the best they can be.

 Q: Will there be a QuakeWorld version of Quake Rally?
 A: No. Quake Rally was made possible only by breaking almost
    all of the rules which allow QW to do what it does.

 Q: Why isn't there a <insert car> in the vehicle selection?
 A: Quake Rally was not designed as a "commercial" product and so the
    design process for the most part was based almost entirely on having
    fun making it rather than putting any serious thought into the
    best vehicles to choose to make everyone happy and cover a wide
    range of styles.

 Q: Why not sell Quake Rally commercially instead of releasing it free?
 A: Good question! Hmm.. To make it commercially viable would have required
    at least another 4 months work on top of the ~7 months work spent on
    it to this point. Since it was not designed as a commercial project
    from the start, if we were to actually start again from stratch we
    could easily make a much better game, and so we felt the extra work
    would have been largely wasted. Plus, we suspect most people would
    be happier to see it as a free addon.

 Q: Why remove all the Quake baddies?
 A: Originally for QuakeC space, but the monsters are not in the same
    scale as the Quake Rally "world" so we would need to scale them all.
    Also, they don't tend to fit the theme too well.

 Q: Why doesn't the in-car view work in multiplayer games or in .dems?
 A: This is a Quake engine networking issue. The QC code that makes the in-car
    view possible uses network calls which have to be sent out to the clients
    on every frame (frame being a screen redraw for the client). Since the
    client's frame rate is often much faster than the server, these messages get
    out of synch, and therefore the screen becomes jerky. This is one of the reasons
    the In-Car view is not officially supported, we provide it as-is, and with
    no guarantees. Please do not email us regarding any problems concerning the
    in-car view.

 Q: Why can't I use the Quake Rally textures in non-Quake Rally maps?
 A: As mentioned in the copyright section below, the qrally.wad textures
    are only to be used in maps for Quake Rally. The textures took a LOT
    of time and work to create, with the aim of giving QR a "unique" visual
    appeal, and so by keeping their usage limited to QR maps, we save the
    "look" for QR. Also, we didn't spend 7 months work on QR to see the work
    go into other peoples projects. (if you were paying for QR then this
    situation may have been different)

 Q: Why no gears?
 A: Never got around to it. May have taken away from the arcade'y feel of
    the game too, although it leaves possibilities open for the future.

    Ridah's note: In Deathmatch, you don't wanna be frigging around with no gears!
    Editors note: Yes, what Ridah said too!

 Q: How about adding <feature>?
 A: We have enough ideas for at least two more full revisions of Quake
    Rally, plus since there are 15+ years of racing games available
    for reference, ideas are an easy commodity to find. However, if you
    are running a permanent Quake Rally server and would like some
    additions to make things easier to admin, we may be able to help out.
    See the contact section.

 Q: Why don't the cars travel a lot faster?
 A: We tried a range of speeds and the one we ended up with gave the best
    balance between gameplay, map-size and apparent speed. To have Sega Rally
    type speeds would require some huge maps.

 Q: Where are these bots that keep being mentioned?
 A: They were still in production at time of release.

-=> KNOWN BUGS <=-

    Yes, there are some bugs in Quake Rally. Please read this list before
    mailing us with any problems.

 B: There are problems when playing QR with glQuake.
 E: We're aware that glQuake does some strange things and one "fix" which
    might help is to delete your /id1/glquake directory and see if that
    helps. Zoid and Morbid have been working on a new version of glQuake
    which will fix most of the remaining problems, although the slowdown
    around large areas of sky may be still apparent.

 B: The cars don't look like they are sitting on the ground sometimes.
 E: Bounding boxes in Quake don't rotate with the mdl, so when the car
    is on big angled surfaces it can hover a bit on occasions.

 B: In map <map name> there are places where the car slows down/stops.
 E: These are just QBSP errors. Think of them as pot-holes and try to
    avoid them each lap :).

 B: The little Quake version number on the console background is a weird
    yellow mess.
 E: This is printed by Quake itself and it works out its colours by rotating
    the palette of the console font. Since our font is a different colour
    than the old Quake one, it looks a bit crappy.

 B: The car colours in the intro demo don't match from shot to shot.
 E: The bots aren't considered "player" entities meaning that they don't
    have skin (shirt/pants) information which meant there wasn't the ability
    to match 1:1 all the colours.

 B: The cars in the intro demo sometimes stop.
 E: The bots were recorded early in production and so being early versions
    of the bot code they don't have all the fine tuning of the finished ones.
