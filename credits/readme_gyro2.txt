Online Documentaion
-------------------
Due to the growing complexity of Gyro 2, a simple text file is no longer able to provide
sufficient documentation. To this end, the online GyroDocs have been created and can be
accessed here: http://quakematt.quakedev.com/gyrodocs/

The GyroDocs will always contain the most up-to-date information, including installation
instructions and function reference, all presented in a clear and easy-to-navigate format.

In the future, I hope to make the GyroDocs available as a downloadable package for offline
use. When complete, they will be found at the Gyro homepage: http://quakematt.quakedev.com/gyro.php
