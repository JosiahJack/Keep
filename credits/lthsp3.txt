* Other Info *

NOTE: You need to have LTHSP2 to play this map. Put the contents of
this zip file into the same directory that you installed LTHSP2 into.
Overwrite any old files with the new ones (but I guess you should still
make a backup copy first - just in case).

R_SPEEDS - just to let you know, r_speeds reports 300-700 polys
throughout most of the map, and 1000-ish in a few places in the first
atrium.

You may not be able to see how many secrets there are in this map due to
the length of the title - there are 3. Gotta catch 'em all!

* Author's Note *

This is my third released SP map. The first two were both base maps, but I
thought I'd do a castle-type one for a change. This map is very much
inspired by Tyrann's incredible Moonlight Assault level, and the textures
are the same. The architecture is not, however (his is much better!).

LTHSP4 may be Egyptian. Or it might be another base map. We shall see.

* Copyright / Permissions *

The map and its associated bumpf (this text file, the rest of the
contents of the zip file) are to be distributed intact and unmodified.
Persecutors will be violated. Or something.

If you want to use any of the things that aren't maps, ie. models / sounds,
for another mod / level, you may do so BUT you must credit me in the text
file for said mod / level, and also list the URL of my website (above). And
I wouldn't mind an email from you either - I have the QC files for all of
my custom monsters, so I could make your life easier...
