This is a four map pack based on the Rubicon 2 mod by Metslime / CZG.
It includes new enemies and various new features.

1. Copy the pack file into a subdirectory of your Quake directory 
called rrp
2. Launch a Quake engine that supports the BSP2 format; the preferred 
one is Quakespasm (august 29th prerelease) 0.85.10 which you can get 
here - http://celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=60452&start=1108
3. Launch the engine with the command line: 
-game rrp -heapsize 256000 -zone 4096
3. Start a new game as normal from the menu (start game)

I stole assets from all over the place to put this together.  
I've tried to reference everyone but chances are I forgot to include one 
or more, some of the models came from older packs that were then 
repainted / modified.  If your work has been included but you were not 
referenced then let me know.
