Description             : Just some junk I made and decided to call a
                          TC. NOTE: I do not have permission to use all
                          the models I in this TC. They are all free,
                          but not for use in a TC. I will remove them,
                          or get permission before the final version.

New Demos               : Why bother?
New Models              : Yup
QuakeC Patches          : Sure

* Construction *

Base                    : Whuda ya think?? A COW! K?
Editor(s) used          : Quake Army Knife 4.02 to make the desc., QME to make the cheap MDLs, my hands to make the Quake-C.
Known Bugs              : Yeah the losy sniper don't cut thru armor. I
                          made it so the sniper bullet does the damage
                          of the person it hits health. I figured that
                          would just kill them w/ no gib. But if u have
                          armor... Also can't get the shots to line up
				  wif the barrel.
Build Time              : Ah, 2 or 3 days. Not worth it really...

Comments                : I can hear that Fox comming...
