Quoth - Part Two
----------------------------

"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore..."

Welcome to the third edition of Quoth 2. This is a spit-and-polish release, with some new features to play with, but the emphasis on refining the Quoth 2 content, re-balancing some monsters, fixing old bugs, and keeping Quoth as lightweight as possible.

The new home for Quoth is http://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth and the mapping tutorial and changelog can be found there. Also, for help, tech support and further releases, keep an eye on Func_Msgboard: http://celephais.net/board
 

----------------------------
Installation
----------------------------

Create a subfolder in your /quake directory called /quoth. Extract quoth.zip into it. This package is the full install, and contains all the files you need to run Quoth.

The quickest way to launch the game is to run the launch.bat file provided. If you're a Quake veteran and prefer to launch manually, add the following to your quake engine command line:

-hipnotic -game quoth

The -hipnotic option enables the Scourge Of Armagon HUD layout that we have utilized for our powerups and weapons. You do not need to have Scourge Of Armagon installed for this to work.

If you don't have a custom quake engine, you will miss out on some of the features of Quoth, and we recommend you grab fitzquake from
