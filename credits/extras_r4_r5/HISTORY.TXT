07/08/2002
- emitter particle movetype now allows MOVETYPE_FLY
- emitter particles with positive damage spawn blood/sparks when doing damage, and can also spawn TE_ effects if hitting the world
- emitter additions above mean they can be used for custom traps (like spinning spike shooters)
- emitter angles work as per the documentation - REALLY THIS TIME! (H angle was incorrect under certain circumstances)
- attract, push, and trubulence t_effectors can have a "tangential" spawnflag (face new direction)
- added trigger_chat, trigger_chat_relay, trigger_shake and trigger_enemy (/src/extras/extras_triggers.qc)
- added func_breakaway and func_model (/src/extras/extras_misc.qc)
- func_explobsp can now be set to "heal" like func_breakaway
- tweaked ladder jumps slightly (easier to jump-climb)
- added Hipnotic rotating entities (already had the Quiver defs so figured what the hell...)
- several more URQP <http://www.inside3d.com/qip/> fixes:
	1998-12-23 Movetarget correction in monster start functions fix by Maddes
	1998-08-14 Monsters sometimes do not move fix by Perged
	1997-12-23 Fish fix by Maddes (totalmonsters fix)
	1998-07-24 Wrong obituary messages fix by Zoid
	1998-08-12 Option: Drowning doesn't hurt armor by Maddes/Athos

	1998-08-14 Constantly checking all impulses fix by Perged/Kryten
- fixed all FrikQCC warnings (including some genuine bug fixes to the original Id source)
- added HTML documentation - basically ripped right from source comments, with updates & corrections.
- added a new "emitters" example map.
- moved trigger_relay2 to the new extras_triggers.qc file
- fixed some pixels in "fireball1.spr" that were 100% black (mapped as white with the retail software rendered MacQuake)
- added "smoke1.spr" and "sparkle1.spr" and a "break"sound originally from my Paroxysm mod (use'm if ya like'm)
- Quiver defs updated with new & updated entities, grouping in sync with new docs.

-----------------------------------------
6/29/02
- emitter angle limit system was flawed - it has been re-designed to work as intended. Please read the new documentaion! (whoops! #1)
- t_effector_* triggers can actually be enabled/disabled now (whoops! #2)
- documentation for particle effectors was incorrect; "cnt" should be: Percentage of original velocity to *diminish* not *maintain*
- t_effector_turbulence no longer diminishes velocity for excluded axii (as one would expect)
- added "message" key to emitters (custom death message if killed by a particle)
- added "avelocity" key to emitters (spin emitter angles)
- can now use trigger_changedir, trigger_forward, trigger_reverse, trigger_stop, and trigger_go on emitters to control spin.
- added t_effector_friction - slow down or speed up particles (/src/extras/extras_emitters.qc)
- added trigger_relay2 (/src/extras/extras_misc.qc)
- internal re-working of func_train_ext child objects (not dependant on child.watertype & child links delayed an extra frame to be safe)
- func_water tricks the C code into playing the "splash" sound like it does for real water
- number of SNG shell ejects cut in half when button is held down
- much less likely to get hung up on a corpse (compare absmin_z as well as checkbottom)
- added a couple of new 20fps explosion/fire sprites (use'm if ya like'em - please give me credit)
- "switches" map updated with new emitter effects (last version was kinda rushed)
- Quiver defs updated with new & updated entities, plus some re-wording and corrections

-----------------------------------------
06/24/02
- added func_emitter, func_emitter_volume, and several t_effector* entities (/src/extras/extras_emitters.qc)
- added func_button_ext and func_switch entities (/src/extras/extras_buttons.qc)
- added func_bspframe entity (/src/extras/extras_misc.qc)
- added bspframe, and usetarget support to func_explobsp
- func_explobsp now broadcasts a "real" explosion (uses dynamic lighting effect)
- added alternate start point for non-looped paths and start-in-reverse options to func_train_ext & func_watertrain
- added trigger_forward, trigger_reverse, trigger_stop and trigger_go relays for func_train_ext (/src/extras/extras_train.qc)
- changed all the fx_ entities with "start_off" flags to work like others (with "start_on")
- re-worked train child linking, and fx_* death-on-trigger-touch handling
- shell ejects don't make noise when bouncing (can easily become too much for Quake to handle)
- updated comments/documentation for several entities (scattered throughout the source files)
- added new "switches" example map
- original "testmap" renamed "water", contains a fix to display the slime correctly in the software renderer, and the train buttons are now func_button_ext
- Quiver defs updated with new entities, and re-organized

-----------------------------------------
