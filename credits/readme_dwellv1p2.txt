STORY
Following the destruction of the hideous Shub-Niggurath, you scoured infinite dimensions, a guardian against her deep-rooted rot. Decades passed, and with the whispers slowly subsiding, you were finally laid to rest. A shallow, fitful slumber awaited you for the rest of your days.
That was until now. Being rustled from your rest, the voices whisper yet again. A new god has tangled its tendrils in your reality, constructing legions to its side to reanimate their respective long-dead gods, elements of life itself taken and twisted to their will, all in the hope he shall return to a physical form to consume yet another reality.
You must yet again become the guardian, to take down what dwells beneath...

SPECIAL THANKS
Thanks to..
- Lunaran for the amazing Copper mod, which Dwell uses as a base. And for Underdark Overbright which, together with Scampie, reinvigorated the love for episodic content in a lot of us. Thank you for all the Copper assistance during development, and for the design insights which made the levels as good as they are today. Top lads.
- All who playtested or sent in crucial bug reporting, there's way too many to specifically name but you all had a significant part in making Dwell a success.
- Croteam for Serious Sam, and for the extra models, ripped by Danz.
- Sock for his amazing texture set.
- Muk for emotional support.

ENGINE INFORMATION
- A modified Quake engine with increased limits, transparency support and BSP2 support is required, we recommend Quakespasm Spiked.
- Also tested for compatibility in FTE, MarkV and Quakespasm.
- Darkplaces has major map-breaking issues, it is not recommended.
