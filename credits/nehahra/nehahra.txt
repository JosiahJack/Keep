IMPORTANT!!!

If you have The Seal of Nehahra movie, you should put the game in the
same directory BUT........

DO NOT EXTRACT THE PAK0.PAK file from the PAK0.ZIP as this is a dummy pak file.

****************
I. THE STORY
****************
	Following the demise of ShubNiggurath the gates to a new dimension were flung open to 
	the realm of mankind.  Seizing this opportunity the human civilization on earth
	spent the next five years building a colony in the new dimension.  The humans call
	this new bastion of human civilization Forge City..........

A. Background
      
II. INSTALLING NEHAHRA
A. Installation
   You must install the full registered version of Quake before you can play it.
   Please follow the instructions on your Quake manual for installation instructions
   Nehahra will not run with Shareware version of Quake.  Create a folder in your
   Quake directory and name it nehahra.  Unzip the contents of this zip into the nehahra
   folder, make sure to maintain any directory structure which exists within the zip.  
   
B. Running Nehahra
   Just run the Nehahra.exe executable, that's all she wrote.  No -game
   parameter is necessary.

   Check the Quake documentation for more command line and console commands.
 
III. THE BASICS OF PLAY
A. Goal of the Game
        Quake has two basic goals. First, stay alive. Second, get out of the
        place you're in.  That hasn't changed in Nehahra.  First and foremost,
        Nehahra is meant to be survived, not necessarily conquered, though
        there are places where you have no choice.  In some cases you may
        find it a near to impossible task to get %100 kills, unless you have
        the skill. In these scenarios escaping the level itself may be your
        only option.  

B. Skill
	The Nehahra start map allows for skill selection.  Take the path that is
        best for you and keep in mind that Nehahra Easy is a bit like Quake
	Hard :)

        Easy ------The Skilled Player 
        Normal ----The Veteran Player
        Hard ------The Elite
        Nightmare--The Certifiably Insane


C. Episode/Story
        After the starting map, you will be shown the introductory demos
        to the game and storyline.  This is a continuation of the
        Quake movie released called THE SEAL OF NEHAHRA.  It is not
        necessary that you obtain THE SEAL OF NEHAHRA, but it is
        highly recommended as you'll be otherwise missing out.

        ((See http://www.planetquake.com/nehahra/download.html for links
        to the movie))

        After the first game three demos, the interaction begins.  Through
        the course of the game, you will experience in-between level
        demo scenes and the occasional in-level cutscene.

        To shut off .dem cutscenes, you may type at the console:

                CUTSCENE 0

D. The Environment

        Nehahra maintains the standard Quake environment with secret
        doors, lifts, trains, and the like.  In addition to this,
        you may encounter an object or section of architecture that
        is pushable, breakable, or interactive in other ways.
        Experimentation and exploration in different situations is always 
        beneficial.


IV:  YOUR NEW ENVIRONMENT


A. Firepower

   Sword

      Hey, something new to look at.

   Shotgun  
      The basic gun, to which all other guns compare favorably.

   Double-barrelled Shotgun
      A worthy weapon with three minor drawbacks: first, it uses up 2 shells 
      per blast; second, it's slow; third, its shot pattern is very loose at 
      long range. But in general, once you find this puppy, the other shotgun 
      starts rusting from disuse. 

   Nailgun
      A two-barrel dingus that prickles bad guys with armor-piercing darts, 
      technically termed "nails". 

   Supernailgun 
      The great equalizer. Four cyclic barrels that hose out spikes like 
      crazy. Pro: foes drop like flies. Con: eats ammo like popcorn. 

   Grenade Launcher
      Thumps neat exploding bombs into the air. You can even bounce a grenade
      off the wall or floor.. When a grenade hits someone, it explodes. 
      If it misses, the bomb sits on the floor for a moment, then explodes. 

   Rocket Launcher
      For when a grenade positively, absolutely, has to be there on time. 

   Thunderbolt  
      Try it. You'll like it. Use the same technique as watering your 
      rosebush.

   Autoshotgun(Tsemochian Autoshotgun)
      High speed shotgun from Hell.  You haven't lived until you've
      hosed down some baddies with this.  Just don't get carried away,
      it eats ammo like its going out of style.

   Sprocket Launcher(Tsemochian Sprocket)
      Crossbreed a spear, a rocket, and a grenade and you might end
      up with a Tsemochian sprocket.  This weapon takes some getting
      used to, but after a while, you'll feel nekkid without it. :)

C. Power-ups

   In addition to the traditional power-ups, Nehahra offers:

   Regeneration Artifact
      This powerup never runs out, unless you die.  You can accumulate
      these.  The more regeneration artifacts you have, the more you
      can regenerate and the faster you regenerate.  Five of these
      puppies is the maximum that will have affect.

   Flight Artifact
      This powerup runs out, but lasts longer than the others.  This
      enables you to fly, even take enormous leaps, or hang out on
      the ceiling.  It takes some getting used to, but it's good
      for getting to high places in a hurry :)

   Resurrection Artifact
      The most powerful of all power-ups.  Like the Regeneration
      Artifact, you can accumulate these.  For every Resurrection
      Artifact you have, you can rise from the dead right where
      you fell.  It gives you 3 seconds of Invulnerability when
      you return, use this time wisely to get away from the
      monsters who were likely standing right over you.

      Remember, use your lives sparingly, these artifacts don't
      grow on trees.

      You will notice that when you die, an icon appears on the
      screen.  It could be one of three.  Don't rush to hit
      'quickload' just yet....

      SKULL WITH BLACK EYES:

      This means you are dead, no resurrection artifacts available.
      That's all she wrote.

      SKULL WITH RED EYES:

      This means that you have one or more lives left.  You can
      rejoin the living by simply hitting the attack key or jump.

      SKULL WITH RED EYES WITH AN 'X' OVER IT

      This is unfortunate.  Even this artifact has its limitations.
      If you fall into a void, your accumulated lives will not
      help you.  If you die in lava or you have been gibbed, the
      body has suffered too much damage to be restored.


D. The Cast

   Rottweiler
      Bad, bad doggie! Play dead! -- blam! -- yipe! Good  dog!

   Grunt 
      Between the probes wired up to their pleasure centers that give
      them paroxysms of ecstasy from killing and the stimulants
      flowing through their veins, grunts range from slow to paranoid,
      jumpy, and surprisingly dangerous.  Take care, they could be
      armed with anything!

   Enforcer 
      Grunt, Mark Two.  Outfitted in combat armor, toting built-in blasters, 
      and light on their feet, they range from a nuisance to clever.

   Knight 
      Canned meat. Open 'er up and see if it's still fresh. 

   Death Knight  
      This particular canned meat tends to open you up instead.  Keep
      your distance though, they've learned some new tricks over the
      years.

   Rotfish 
      Disgusting little critters who dish it out, but can't take it.

   Zombie
      Thou canst not kill that which doth not live. But you can blast it 
      into chunky kibbles. 

   Scrag 
      Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. Ugly as hell.  Keep
      your aim steady because these bastards can really move when
      they want to!

   Ogre 
      Since the death of Shub-Niggurath, ogres have come to exercise
      more free will than ever before.  Although sometimes cautious
      and other times wanting to save their ass, they can still dish
      out the pain!

   Spawn  
      A merrily bouncing blob as dangerous to kill as to ignore. Blech.

   Fiend 
      In essence, organic buzzsaws, rife with pummeling power!  Fiends
      are creatures of varied dispositions, some may be indifferent.
      Beware the alpha fiends that walk among them, these guys are
      especially territorial and cranky.

   Vore  
      A spideresque hybrid horror. Keep your eye on the energy pod he hurls. 

   Shambler 
      Even other monsters fear him, so expect a clobbering. He shrugs off 
      explosions. Good luck. 

   Marines
      These guys are on your side...in theory.  You might find a few
      survivors of the latest fiasco in the lands of Quake.  Some of
      them might even help you out.  Be wary of them at times, they
      are stressed, scared shitless, and not sure who to trust.
      Don't set one of them off or you might become a military
      statistic.

   Field Enforcer
      More human than he is ogre.  One of the many half breeds from
      archgaunt experiments over the course of years and nuclear
      contamination from the ravaged Dimension of the Doomed.  These
      guys are sent out with concealed body armor and an armor shard
      trench coat.  With automatic shotguns as a weapon and the
      stamina and strength of an ogre, they can prove to be a
      tactical nightmare.

   Ogre Mutant
      More ogre than he is human.  He's missing an appendage but
      Tsemochian technology has generously provided him with an
      alternative, a nice big gun with some convenient features.
      He's a bit slow in the head, but once he's drawn a bead on you,
      run for cover; having a weapon for an arm has allowed him to
      become very efficient with it.

   Tsemoch
      Caffeine incarnate.  With modern weaponry and unearthly
      metabolisms, they are the strange products of evolution in an
      alternate dimension.  A little more insect than man.  Some 
      of them tote Tsemochian sprockets, if you hear a *thoomp*,
      head for the hills!  It just takes one sprocket to ruin your
      afternoon.

   Jaggers
      Once flourishing in the Tsemochian dimension, these
      animals have seeped into every dimension touching it.
      It takes a lot to drop one so if you can deal with them
      peacefully, save some ammo.  Give them some respect
      and space and you might not get "jagged".

   Gaunt
      The monks of the medieval society.  They like to gossip and
      they're not afraid to tell you what's on their mind...not
      that you'll understand a word of it.  Not too hard to drop,
      but don't get them excited...their bag of tricks is deeper
      than you might suspect.

   Archgaunts
      Hierarchs in the making.  These pompous, elder gaunts are
      skilled in the Gaunt magics and masters of aggravation.
      Fighting these guys is about as fun as a root canal.  Good
      luck with them!

   Barons
      A few hundred years ago, a large group of death knights
      deserted the ranks of Shub-Niggurath, tired of tolerating
      Archgaunt councils and the restrictions of the former
      Archgaunt Hierarch, Zagheida.  Since the death of Shub-
      Niggurath and Hierarch Zagheida, they've come out of hiding
      from remote medieval highlands and returned to their roots.

    Vomitus
      An organic gib fountain.  Slow, stupid, and not too dangerous.
      Slip by them and fry the bigger fish, a few years later, they
      might catch up with you.

    Wraith
      Ghosts to the world, scavengers of souls.  Existing in two
      planes simultaneously, they vulture on the dead and go about
      their strange agendas.  Try not to anger them unless you
      have a handle on how to hurt them :)

V.  TECHNICAL NOTES

1.  Coop mode is available.  Keep in mind that Coop mode shuts off
    all in-level cutscenes as well as in-between level demo cutscenes.

2.  If you have already seen the demo cutscenes and don't wish to
    watch them when you play again, hit the `tilde to bring down the
    console and set CUTSCENE 0.  Set it back to 1 to re-enable demo
    cutscenes.

    ((NOTE:  There is a bug whereby weapons will not be returned to you.
    It does not appear to happen often, but this bug is extremely elusive
    and because of this, unfixable at this time))

3.  If you want to tone down the AI (especially on the Tech monsters: grunts,
enforcers, etc) to bring it a little closer to normal Quake gameplay) go to the console
and set the NOMONSTERS cvar to 1, setting it to 0 returns it to normal.  0 is the default.

4.  If you want normal Quake explosions, set NO_SPR32 to 1
