DEVELOPMENT NOTES ON DEMOS
--------------------------

How to play a demo after a map is explained in the devkit1.txt.
IF you decide you want to try to create a .dem of your own to place
inbetween maps or whatnot.  There are a few things you should do in
the demo file itself for it work correctly in Nehahra.


AT THE END OF THE DEMO...
you will want a stuffcmd directly to the console of the following:

NEHX15 1

if you wish it to load a map from there then stuffcmd a

MAP BLAH

message, BLAH being the name of the map.  If it links to another
demo, then you will want:

PLAYDEMO DEMONAME

------------------

How you accomplish the demo is up to you.  QuakeC knowledge is almost
a must unless you set it up by other means.
