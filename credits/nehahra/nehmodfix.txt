Some may have noticed the music files don't play on neh1m9, neh2m6, and nehend.
This fixes this, if you unzip the files and pay attention to the filepaths.

atmos2.xm
nehend.s3m

These go in your quake/nehahra/mods dir, not Paked, the engine apparently does
not recognize sound files paked up.

Gracias and Enjoy.
