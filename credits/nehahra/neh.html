	<p class=text><i>Installation</i>
<br>
ï You must install the full registered version of Quake before you can play it. Please follow the instructions on your Quake manual for installation instructions Nehahra will not run with Shareware version of Quake.  Create a folder in your Quake directory and name it nehahra.  Unzip the contents of this zip into the nehahra folder, make sure to maintain any directory structure which exists within the zip.	
<br>
<br>
<i>Running Nehahra</i>
<br>
ï You may use the .bat file included in this zip to run Nehahra, or create your own using the -game parameter.  The .bat file included with this zip runs Nehahra using many settings which the Nehahra team prefers to use while playing Quake. If you choose not to use the .bat file, run Nehahra using the command line nehahra -game nehahra. Check the Quake documentation for more command line and <a href="http://www.eplanetquake.com/console" target="new">console</a> commands.

	<p class=text><i>Goal of the Game</i>
<br>
ï Quake has two basic goals. First, stay alive. Second, get out of the place you're in.  That hasn't changed in Nehahra.  First and foremost, Nehahra is meant to be survived, not necessarily conquered, though there are places where you have no choice.  In some cases you may find it a near to impossible task to get %100 kills, unless you have the skill. In these scenarios escaping the level itself may be your only option.  
<br>
<br>
<i>Skill</i>
<br>
ï The Nehahra start map allows for skill selection.  Take the path that is best for you and keep in mind that Nehahra Easy is a bit like Quake Hard :)
<br>
<br>
Easy: The Skilled Player 
<br>
Normal: The Veteran Player
<br>
Hard: The Elite
<br>
Nightmare: The Certifiably Insane

<br>
<br>
<i>Episode/Story</i>
<br>
        ï After the starting map, you will be shown the introductory demos
        to the game and storyline.  This is a continuation of the
        Quake movie released called THE SEAL OF NEHAHRA.  It is not
        necessary that you obtain THE SEAL OF NEHAHRA, but it is
        highly recommended as you'll be otherwise missing out.
<br>
        ï See <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/nehahra/download.html"><b>here</b></a> for links
        to the movie
<br>
        ï After the first game three demos, the interaction begins.  Through
        the course of the game, you will experience in-between level
        demo scenes and the occasional in-level cutscene.
<br>
<br>
<i>The Environment</i>
<br>
        ï Nehahra maintains the standard Quake environment with secret
        doors, lifts, trains, and the like.  In addition to this,
        you may encounter an object or section of architecture that
        is pushable, breakable, or interactive in other ways.
        Experimentation and exploration in different situations is always 
        beneficial.

<i>Firepower</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Sword</b>
<br>
     Hey, something new to look at.
<br>
<br>
<b>Shotgun</b>  
<br>
      The basic gun, to which all other guns compare favorably.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Double-barrelled Shotgun</b>
<br>
      A worthy weapon with three minor drawbacks: first, it uses up 2 shells 
      per blast; second, it's slow; third, its shot pattern is very loose at 
      long range. But in general, once you find this puppy, the other shotgun 
      starts rusting from disuse. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Nailgun</b>
<br>
      A two-barrel dingus that prickles bad guys with armor-piercing darts, 
      technically termed "nails". 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Supernailgun </b>
<br>
      The great equalizer. Four cyclic barrels that hose out spikes like 
      crazy. Pro: foes drop like flies. Con: eats ammo like popcorn. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Grenade Launcher</b>
<br>
      Thumps neat exploding bombs into the air. You can even bounce a grenade
      off the wall or floor.. When a grenade hits someone, it explodes. 
      If it misses, the bomb sits on the floor for a moment, then explodes. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Rocket Launcher</b>
<br>
      For when a grenade positively, absolutely, has to be there on time. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Thunderbolt  </b>
<br>
      Try it. You'll like it. Use the same technique as watering your 
      rosebush.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Autoshotgun(Tsemochian Autoshotgun)</b>
<br>
      High speed shotgun from Hell.  You haven't lived until you've
      hosed down some baddies with this.  Just don't get carried away,
      it eats ammo like its going out of style.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Sprocket Launcher(Tsemochian Sprocket)</b>
<br>
      Crossbreed a spear, a rocket, and a grenade and you might end
      up with a Tsemochian sprocket.  This weapon takes some getting
      used to, but after a while, you'll feel nekkid without it. :)

<br>
<br>
<i>Power-ups</i>
<br>
   In addition to the traditional power-ups, Nehahra offers:
<br>
<br>
<b>Regeneration Artifact</b>
<br>
      This powerup never runs out, unless you die.  You can accumulate
      these.  The more regeneration artifacts you have, the more you
      can regenerate and the faster you regenerate.  Five of these
      puppies is the maximum that will have affect.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Flight Artifact</b>
<br>
      This powerup runs out, but lasts longer than the others.  This
      enables you to fly, even take enormous leaps, or hang out on
      the ceiling.  It takes some getting used to, but it's good
      for getting to high places in a hurry :)
<br>
<br>
   <b>Resurrection Artifact</b>
<br>
      The most powerful of all power-ups.  Like the Regeneration
      Artifact, you can accumulate these.  For every Resurrection
      Artifact you have, you can rise from the dead right where
      you fell.  It gives you 3 seconds of Invulnerability when
      you return, use this time wisely to get away from the
      monsters who were likely standing right over you.
<br>
<br>
      Remember, use your lives sparingly, these artifacts don't
      grow on trees.
<br>
<br>
      You will notice that when you die, an icon appears on the
      screen.  It could be one of three.  Don't rush to hit
      'quickload' just yet....
<br>
<br>
      SKULL WITH BLACK EYES:
<br>
      This means you are dead, no resurrection artifacts available.
      That's all she wrote.
<br>
<br>
      SKULL WITH RED EYES:
<br>
      This means that you have one or more lives left.  You can
      rejoin the living by simply hitting the attack key or jump.
<br>
<br>
      SKULL WITH RED EYES WITH AN 'X' OVER IT
<br>
      This is unfortunate.  Even this artifact has its limitations.
      If you fall into a void, your accumulated lives will not
      help you.  If you die in lava or you have been gibbed, the
      body has suffered too much damage to be restored.
<br>
<br>
<i>The Cast</i>
<br>
<br>

   <b>Rottweiler</b>
<br>
      Bad, bad doggie! Play dead! -- blam! -- yipe! Good  dog!
<br>
<br>
   <b>Grunt </b>
<br>
      Between the probes wired up to their pleasure centers that give
      them paroxysms of ecstasy from killing and the stimulants
      flowing through their veins, grunts range from slow to paranoid,
      jumpy, and surprisingly dangerous.  Take care, they could be
      armed with anything!
<br>
<br>
   <b>Enforcer </b>
<br>
      Grunt, Mark Two.  Outfitted in combat armor, toting built-in blasters, 
      and light on their feet, they range from a nuisance to clever.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Knight </b>
<br>
      Canned meat. Open 'er up and see if it's still fresh. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Death Knight  </b>
<br>
      This particular canned meat tends to open you up instead.  Keep
      your distance though, they've learned some new tricks over the
      years.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Rotfish </b>
<br>
      Disgusting little critters who dish it out, but can't take it.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Zombie</b>
<br>
      Thou canst not kill that which doth not live. But you can blast it 
      into chunky kibbles. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Scrag </b>
<br>
      Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. Ugly as hell.  Keep
      your aim steady because these bastards can really move when
      they want to!
<br>
<br>
   <b>Ogre </b>
<br>
      Since the death of Shub-Niggurath, ogres have come to exercise
      more free will than ever before.  Although sometimes cautious
      and other times wanting to save their ass, they can still dish
      out the pain!
<br>
<br>
   <b>Spawn  </b>
<br>
      A merrily bouncing blob as dangerous to kill as to ignore. Blech.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Fiend </b>
<br>
      In essence, organic buzzsaws, rife with pummeling power!  Fiends
      are creatures of varied dispositions, some may be indifferent.
      Beware the alpha fiends that walk among them, these guys are
      especially territorial and cranky.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Vore  </b>
<br>
      A spideresque hybrid horror. Keep your eye on the energy pod he hurls. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Shambler </b>
<br>
      Even other monsters fear him, so expect a clobbering. He shrugs off 
      explosions. Good luck. 
<br>
<br>
   <b>Marines</b>
<br>
      These guys are on your side...in theory.  You might find a few
      survivors of the latest fiasco in the lands of Quake.  Some of
      them might even help you out.  Be wary of them at times, they
      are stressed, scared shitless, and not sure who to trust.
      Don't set one of them off or you might become a military
      statistic.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Field Enforcer</b>
<br>
      More human than he is ogre.  One of the many half breeds from
      archgaunt experiments over the course of years and nuclear
      contamination from the ravaged Dimension of the Doomed.  These
      guys are sent out with concealed body armor and an armor shard
      trench coat.  With automatic shotguns as a weapon and the
      stamina and strength of an ogre, they can prove to be a
      tactical nightmare.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Ogre Mutant</b>
<br>
      More ogre than he is human.  He's missing an appendage but
      Tsemochian technology has generously provided him with an
      alternative, a nice big gun with some convenient features.
      He's a bit slow in the head, but once he's drawn a bead on you,
      run for cover; having a weapon for an arm has allowed him to
      become very efficient with it.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Tsemoch</b>
<br>
      Caffeine incarnate.  With modern weaponry and unearthly
      metabolisms, they are the strange products of evolution in an
      alternate dimension.  A little more insect than man.  Some 
      of them tote Tsemochian sprockets, if you hear a *thoomp*,
      head for the hills!  It just takes one sprocket to ruin your
      afternoon.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Jaggers</b>
<br>
      Once flourishing in the Tsemochian dimension, these
      animals have seeped into every dimension touching it.
      It takes a lot to drop one so if you can deal with them
      peacefully, save some ammo.  Give them some respect
      and space and you might not get "jagged".
<br>
<br>
   <b>Gaunt</b>
<br>
      The monks of the medieval society.  They like to gossip and
      they're not afraid to tell you what's on their mind...not
      that you'll understand a word of it.  Not too hard to drop,
      but don't get them excited...their bag of tricks is deeper
      than you might suspect.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Archgaunts</b>
<br>
      Hierarchs in the making.  These pompous, elder gaunts are
      skilled in the Gaunt magics and masters of aggravation.
      Fighting these guys is about as fun as a root canal.  Good
      luck with them!
<br>
<br>
   <b>Barons</b>
<br>
      A few hundred years ago, a large group of death knights
      deserted the ranks of Shub-Niggurath, tired of tolerating
      Archgaunt councils and the restrictions of the former
      Archgaunt Hierarch, Zagheida.  Since the death of Shub-
      Niggurath and Hierarch Zagheida, they've come out of hiding
      from remote medieval highlands and returned to their roots.
<br>
<br>
    <b>Vomitus</b>
<br>
      An organic gib fountain.  Slow, stupid, and not too dangerous.
      Slip by them and fry the bigger fish, a few years later, they
      might catch up with you.
<br>
<br>
    <b>Wraith</b>
<br>
      Ghosts to the world, scavengers of souls.  Existing in two
      planes simultaneously, they vulture on the dead and go about
      their strange agendas.  Try not to anger them unless you
      have a handle on how to hurt them :)

ï A small measure of the massive code that makes up the progs.dat were
  originally adapted from early patches performing various tasks.
  Because code has migrated from patch to patch over time, the
  original sources become very vague and questionable.
  While the code may not be recognizable to the original, Mindcrime
  would like to thank the creators of these patches whom he has no
