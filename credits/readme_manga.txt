Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

Wanna see manga babes kicking your ass in your maps?
This is for you.

I had in mind to do a total conversion on a manga/anime theme, so 
I did this model. But it took some much time to make a single model,
that a TC sounds crazy right now... 


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a directory called manga in your quake directory.
Unzip "mangab.zip" into the manga directory, taking care to
retain the directory structure.


move "mangamap.bsp" in quake/id1/maps

cd back to quake and type
quake -game manga +map mangamap

And you should be playing in a single room with a babe. ;)


To include Manga Babe in your new levels, simply place an entity
with a classname of "monster_manga" into your map.  




Technical Details
-----------------

I've included the qc file in the progs directory, it's probably dirty,
but you can add your modification if you wish too.
