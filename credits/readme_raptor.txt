Build time    : We wont go into that...

Note:  This is a BETA version of the Raptor.  I hope to get another death
animation and also another attack in there when I can.  There will also be
more sounds.  The sample for the jump at the moment sucks very much.  Well
its not that bad a sample-its just that there is only one sample and it
becomes repedative after a while.

Quake C  : yes
Sound    : yes
MDL      : yes (Including gib for head)

Format of QuakeC (if a Quake C Mod)

.qc files     : yes (in case you want to fiddle)
progs.dat     : yes


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Just unzip the file in a directory called raptor in your quake directory.
Then start the game       quake -game raptor
You may then proceed to do what youve always wanted to do after watching
Jurassic Park, and that is-kill the dinosaurs.

Known bugs
* Sounds are too repedative.  Only solution...  to make more and have it
  alternate between sounds.

Author Information
------------------
This is my first Quake model, well actually its the first of any model Ive
made in a 3d package.  I learnt 3dstudio as this model was built, which
explains why it has taken so long to finish.  No doubt that future models
will be built on a much faster basis now that I know what Im doing.  Future
projects are -   T-Rex, Dilophosaur and Triceratops to name a few.  Jurassic
Quake will make use of QuakeTorch written by Gopal Nener and a few other
additions like multiple skins on dinosaurs (different patterns and damage
skins).
