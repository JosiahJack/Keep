                           That's my first Quake map actually, be indulgent :)
						   
						   Due to my specific Hexen II background, expect some puzzles.
						   So if after 15 minutes of running everywhere like a headless
						   chicken you've no idea what to do next, just calm down, take 
						   a breath and go back watching/reading more carefully. ;-)
						   It will be worth it, I promise!
						   (The map gets actually better and better as you progress)

                 *** !!! SUPER IMPORTANT !!! ***
===========================================================================
This mod is specifically tailored for FTE.
Any attempt with another engine will screw up so please don't try!
You can get FTE here: https://fte.triptohell.info/

Copy the unholy directory in Quake's root directory (where fteqw.exe has to be)
Then launch the included batch file or type this (the actual exe name might slightly differ): 

fteqw.exe -game unholy +map briefing

Additional Credits to   : ID & Raven guys for the fantastic games they made!

                          Michael Houston for his super kind endorsement for using his legendary characters Dank & Scud (do read their adventures if you don't know them already: http://www.dankandscud.com/issues/ a pure (master)piece of Quake fandom history!)
                          Joshua Skelton https://joshua.itch.io/quake-tools (code for animating models + nice tools)
                          Bal for his decisive help when everything seemed hopeless with lighting models in dark corners or never opening doors
                          4LT for having told me about the existence of the origin brushes in Quake, which allowed nice rotating doors in the penultimate part of the map
                          MissLavender for having kindly crafted more easily tileable versions of wood1_7 & wood1_8 textures
                          Philip Klevestav for his custom Half Life textures used for Dank & Scud's closets.
                          bmFbr for his implementation of switchable shadows used on a few doors and the end of the church

                          Steviemic for his never failing support and his base brushwork I used for the grand remixed Quake logo at the skull door
                          Would you guess I put some authentic aklo in the map? It all comes from this page: https://www.naguide.com/call-of-cthulhu-rlyehian-language-guide/
