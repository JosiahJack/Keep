The story for this double pack is the following:
--------------------------------------------------------------

It's time. Once again.

Even the ancient gods cry out for earthly help. The realms of the son and daughter of 
the mighty god Zeus, Apollo and Artemis, have been overrun by evil creatures
unleashing from the hellish dimension of Quake.

The Interdimensional Intelligence Agency (IIA) has once again put you in
charge of cleaning up in these forgotten places. There's no return unless you can
find the rune of Black Magic to stop Quake from changing the ever-lasting
fate of the Kingdom of Gods: The Halls of Artemis, and Apollo's Domain.

Paintings in final areas taken from:

Artemis (Latin Diana; Etruscan Artumes). The daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin 
of the god Apollo. Born before him, she is said to have helped deliver him, 
reflecting her role as a goddess of childbirth, along with Hera and Eileithyia. She is 
also the virgin goddess, and defender of chastity, and patroness of the hunt. 
Attributes: She is often depicted carrying a bow and arrow and wearing animal skins or 
accompanied by animals. She may appear bathing together with chaste maidens. Often appears
together with her brother Apollo. 

Apollo (Latin Phoebus Apollo; Etruscan Aplu). The son of Zeus and Leto and the twin of 
the goddess Artemis. The lord of Parnassus, he is associated with the tending of flocks 
and herds, and personifies the sun, love of beauty, balance, music, fine arts, poetry and 
medicine. He is the god of phrophecy and is credited with the foundation of the oracle of
Delphi. Attributes: A young and often beautiful man holding the lyre, the bow and arrow, 
or the symbols of Delphi's oracle, the tripod and/or the omphalos. Often appears together 
with his sister Artemis.
