Comments
--------
Thank you to all of the mappers who participated, including a few of you who ran out of time.
This sewer theme sparked a lot of interest, and I was glad to see a few new mappers join in.
Specifically, congratulations to Axebeard and Ryan "Arma" Trawick on their first maps for Quake!

Thank you also to Khreathor for his work setting up the mod that we used for the jam.
More info on that below. He also added a new pipe weapon model to replace the axe, and it's great!

About the mod
-------------
Here are Khreathor's notes:

Sewer Jam progs is based on "Extras". It has few bugfixes, few new features and 2 new enemies (Eel and Hydra).
This mod is still developed/maintained. You can find latest code here: https://bitbucket.org/khreathor/extras_r5/src/master/
Code in this pack has all commits for 08/22/2019 (last commit: 5e9b544)
I don't guarantee latest builds from repo will work flawlessly with these maps,
so best to play them with progs supported with this pack.
