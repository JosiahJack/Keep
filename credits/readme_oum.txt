================================================================

* How to Install: *

Unzip the contents into an OUM subfolder off your Quake 1 folder. E.g. I have
Quake under C:\QUAKE, so I'd unzip this to C:\QUAKE\OUM - it's about 27MB.

To run, either use a launcher program (if you have one) or run your preferred Quake engine with
-GAME OUM +MAP START at the prompt.

It is advisable to add -HEAPSIZE 16384 if running under WinQuake or GLQuake, or
-WINMEM 16 under DOSQuake.

* Using the Weapons *

Key 1: Cycles between the Axe and Chainsaw
Key 2: Cycles between the Shotgun and Riot Controller
Key 3: Switches between the rapid-fire and charge modes of the Antimatter Cannon.
	In charge mode, hold the fire button down to wind the thing up. Release to actually
	shoot. WARNING: Overcharging causes the gun to explode.
Key 4: Cycles between Nailgun and Perforator
Key 5: Plasma Cannon
Key 6: Grenade Launcher
Key 7: Rocket Launcher
Key 8: Thunderbolt
