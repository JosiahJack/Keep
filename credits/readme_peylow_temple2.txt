Misc. Author Info       : Maker of Doom Episode 'Enter my Limbo', QC addon
                          'Flesh is eternal', sound code in Bad Mood on Atari

Description             : This level is designed and optimized for both single
			  and multi player games. It is my first level I have
			  designed and so far only a beta to test out the balance
			  for both single and multiplayer games.
			  I beg you to try out the level and report all kinds of
			  comments such as: It is to dark there and here, it is
			  unfair having both this and that in that area. It is a
			  little bit to hard to beat the enemies in that part etc..
			  I promise that everybody that gives me constructive
			  critics will be mentioned in future updates and/or new
			  levels made by me. Thanx in advance.
