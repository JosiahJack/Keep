Simply place this pak file in a directory called anaconda - parallel with your id1 directory under your Quake directory. To start the game, type "quake -game anaconda" from the command line (without the quotes).

Start a new game and you'll be ready to go. The map in the pak file is called "start.bsp" so Quake will default to this when you start a new game. There's no need to type anything at the console.

Have fun and good luck!
