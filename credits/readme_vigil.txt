Contents: 	pak0.pak - New sounds, QC, a map, and a good whoopin'.
		All textures are from id's, Hipnotic's, Rogue's packs, or made
		from various pictures I found on the web, with the exception
		of the red velvet in the casket, which was done by Neil Manke
web:		http://brains2.wpic.pitt.edu
Thanks to:	Neil Manke for texture help, Gary Griggs for QC help,
		Ryan Freebern for promoting this map so heavily
		All the guys from #qteam and #level_design for testing
		and feedback, drop by and say hi.
		Albert Camus, for giving me the idea of a vigil...  You guys
			read 'The Stranger' right?

TO RUN THIS MAP:  make a subdirectory off of your Quake directory
called "vigil" and put the pak0.pak file included in the vigil.zip
in the \quake\vigil directory.  Next, type quake -game vigil from the
\quake directory and everything should fire up and start you in the map.

PLEASE e-mail me and let me know what you think of this map.
ALSO please read the following info:

There are several QC mods required for this map to work properly, dont unpack the
pak0.pak and expect to be able to play it without the included progs.dat file.
This map is an experiment in gameflow design.

In addition to the Hipnotic entities I used in this map, the progs.dat contains
the following QC mods:
-grunts drop 10 shells instead of 5 when killed
-dead bodies are removed after 45 seconds to prevent slowdown and packet overflows
	(thanks to Gary Griggs of Qteam for showing me how to do this, BTW check out
	 Qteam, it rocks!)
-the axe does 50% more damage and you can swing 20% faster
-new dead body entity (misc_deadplyer)
-new ending cinematics, like when you kill Shub
	
Hello Quaker,
This is my third Quake map project, which also includes my first QC 
work and some sound mods.
Please enjoy it, but I ask that you please e-mail me and let me
know what you honestly think of it. I have left a promising 
grad school track to seek a career in games development, so you could 
really do me a favor by giving me as much feedback as possible.  If you
are looking for a map or graphics designer, consider this a piece of 
my portfolio. You can reach me at bagwell@brain.bns.pitt.edu.

I hope this map is very different than any other map you have ever played 
in Quake, Doom, or any other game of this genre.  The design of this map is
very simple, as you will see. The theme of the map is as follows:  You are
assigned a vigil to watch over a friend's tomb, as he has recently met his
match somewhere in battle.  Soon after your vigil begins, the enemies that
wanted him dead have arrived to give you some punishment...
I visioned a level that had some of the merits of classics like Tetris in 
the Quake environment.  I arranged the triggers so that there are patterns, 
but they are difficult if not impossible to replicate, making the attack 
slightly different each time you play.  Things become more chaotic and 
unpredictable as you progress.
If you can finish it, you are THE MAN (or WOMAN).

PS - I included Neil Manke's authoring sig in this map.. that doesn't mean 
I stole anything from him - he's just a buddy of mine and I thought it would be
cool to throw his sig in there with all the rest of the guys...

Also, if you see me playing Quake, I go by Paul_Bunyan.  You can also see
me on IRC at #level_design or #qteam, where I go by MrBunyan. Also you can 
catch me on ICQ, #1072020

Thanks,

You are NOT allowed to sell this map.
If you want to do anything with this map besides play it unmodified,
please e-mail me first. If you distribute this map, include this file. 
What the hell, e-mail me anyway and tell me what you think. I have spent 
a lot of time making this map, so PLEASE at least humor me.  Thanks!
