              ***  Zerstörer - Testament of the Destroyer  ***


******* Introduction *******

Nihilism Unlimited is proud to present a new experience for Quake...
Zerstörer - Testament of the Destroyer!

A new single-player experience will draw you into a demented world like never
before.  All new professional quality levels make up the Single-player 
episode, complete with cut-scenes to further the story.  You'll wield some 
fantastic weapons and discover amazing artifacts to help you on your journey 
into the Zerstörer's realm.  We haven't forgotten the Multi-player game 
though, as all single-player maps make great deathmatch maps as well ... PLUS 
you'll have another entire episode of deathmatch-only maps to frag in.  Many 
fast-paced and frag-friendly levels have been play-tested to perfection for 
your enjoyment.  Not only that, but you can play them all on QuakeWorld.  


******* Story *******

He took you from the streets and gave you all that you could have asked for. 
He spoke with eloquence of the dreams which he would share with you.  In 
return you ran special missions for him, some mundane and some bizarre.  It 
was not long before you noticed things around you were not always as they 
seemed, but you were well taken care of.  What did it matter anyway?  Things 
have steadily gotten worse, and you are starting to see him in your dreams.  
Nightmares haunt your slumber and leave you with visions you'd kill to 
forget.  It is time to get out of this place while you still can.  Perhaps 
you won't return from the mission tonight.

It all seemed right before the blood stained your hands.  The mission did not 
go as planned, and now you are left with the cold chill of murder under your 
skin.  There wasn't supposed to be anyone here.  You were supposed to find 
medical supplies, but in fact, all you found was a crazed man with a knife.  
Did you just hear laughter?  No, must have been the wind. 

How could you have done this?  What kind of monster have you become?  His 
words all seem twisted now, and you begin to see through his infectious lies. 
He has controlled and manipulated you from the start.  No one will believe 
your story, and as the blood drips from your clenched fists you realize there 
is no one who can help you now. You've got to keep moving, you've got to get 
out of here. Your only choice is to right your wrongs, rewrite what has been 
written. You must make weapons out of his corruption, and use this strength 
he has given you to turn these mistakes against him.  There is no other 
choice.

The final chapter must be written...

Zerstörer - Testament of the Destroyer


******* Installation *******

Unzip into a directory beneath the Quake directory.  (Ex:  c:\quake\zer)

Start by typing:  quake -winmem 12 -game zer

  ** The '-winmem 12' is needed to force some versions of Quake to
  **  allocate enough memory for the massive levels in Zerstörer.
  **  You can substitute bigger numbers for the '12' if you have
  **  lots of RAM.

- Single-player Games

  You should automatically start in the new start map.  If you don't, start
  a new single player game using the menu.  You can now pick your skill
  level and enter the realm of the Zerstörer.  I recommend playing on the 
  'Hard' skill level for maximum enjoyment.

- Deathmatch Games

  You have two choices of level sequences that you can play.
  
  You may choose to play the single-player episode (all maps have been 
  designed for DM play - with weapons, powerups, teleporters, and even 
  new architecture to make the maps suitable for great deathmatch action).
  To play the single-player episode, start on the level 'zer1m1' and the 
  maps will cycle through the single-player episode.

  You may also choose the play the deathmatch specific set of maps.  To play
  these maps, start on the level 'start' and the maps will cycle through the
  deathmatch-only episode.


******* Technical Notes *******

1.  If you have already seen a cut-scene, and would like to stop it, any
impulse will abort.  You may bind a key to an unused impulse, like 100, or
you could just press any number key.  I recommend pressing the key to select
the weapon you are carrying.

2.  glQuake is supported and recommended.  Transparent water is supported in 
the Deathmatch Levels Only.  Much of the single player episode was designed 
before glQuake made transparent water a possibility, so there are areas that 
suffer from high r_speed values if the levels are compiled with transparent 
water.  We are not willing to trade framerate for gee-whiz effects.

3.  It is possible to double the amount of ammo that is contained inside
all weapons.  This is useful for certain modes of deathmatch.  To turn this
feature on in normal Quake, set the 'temp1' CVAR to '22'.  (Go to the
console and type: temp1 22)  To set this feature in QuakeWorld, you must
type: "serverinfo temp1 22" on the server.

4.  There is a file, devkit.zip, which includes all the source code and 
documentation that we accumulated over the course of the project.  Make sure 
you use the unzip option to recreate the directory structure (pkunzip -d).

5.  The new impulses for weapon selection are as follows:
  - New melee weapon == impulse 252  (impulse 1 will also toggle select)
  - Chain-lightning gun == impulse 253  (impulse 8 will also toggle select)
  - ScREw Cannon == impulse 254  (automatically bound to '9')

6.  If you are playing 'zer1m3' and must start over, please use the
console command 'map zer1m3' to start over.  Do not use 'restart', because
an entity will not spawn properly on its bmodel.


******* Weapons *******

(1) Toggles between AXE and a NEW melee weapon.
(2) SHOTGUN - standard issue, but with beefed up cartridges.
(3) RIOT CONTROLLER - Fires two heavy duty cartridges one after another.
(4) CHAINGUN - Unload quite a bit of lead, quickly.
(5) SUPER NAILGUN - standard issue.
(6) GRENADE LAUNCHER - standard issue.
(7) ROCKET LAUNCHER - standard issue.
(8) Toggles between the normal LIGHTNING GUN and the new CHAIN-LIGHTNING GUN.
(9) ScREw CANNON - Fires a plasma charge with an embedded detonator.  While 
		the 'attack' button is held down, the projectile will 
		continue flying until it has bounced twice off solid objects.
		Any time during its flight, you may release the 'attack' 
		button to detonate the plasma for the maximum blast damage.


******* Powerups *******

The Sanguinoch - You'll see.

The Dark-Angel Wings - These take a while to master, but are
very useful once you get used to them.  Look in the direction
you'd like to go, and press jump to flap your wings.

The Courage Armor - A breastplate that will reflect some enemy
fire away from you.  Just don't get shot in the back.
