        The Blood Pool (1dx1)     - A small level which is the 2nd attempt at a level 
                                    by WeAsL. Well laid out with good architecture. Plays
                                    fast and exciting. Good for 2-6 people.

        Banana Mango ][ (1dx2)    - With alot of attention paid to detail this map looks
                                    great. Made by Crom7. It has awesome architecture and with 
                                    a good layout and solid Entity placement this makes for a 
                                    great Dm level. Good for 4-6 people.
        
        CT: Gardens (1dx3)        - A large level made by Map author Gurgeh. For
                                    those of you who like intricate detail and small 
                                    corridors and halls, this is the map for you. Special 
                                    attention paid to detail with large enough open areas 
                                    for a good fight. Good for 6-10 people.
        
        The Wicked Place (1dx4)   - Fashioned After both dm2 and dm4 to give you that Tokay
                                    touch, This level is another of WeAsL's maps. WeAsl Seems
                                    to have a nack for making a good DM level and this one is
                                    no exception. Again, good architecture and well laid out.
                                    with plenty of wide open areas for battles.
                                    Good for 6-12 people.

        The Other Side (1dx5)     - A great DM level made by author Quasimoto. This map 
                                    obviously fashioned after Tokays Dm4. This map is 
                                    excellent, made for both DeathX and Pain Keep this map
                                    is well balanced and definatly gives you that dm4 feel.
                                    Good for 4-8 people.

        Base 311    (1dx6)        - Another of WeAsL's maps, this one is by far his best map yet
                                    with a very good layout and large enough to hold upto 16 people
                                    well without overcrowding, and is easy enough to get around in
                                    that 1 on 1's are not an imposability. WeAsL got tips for this
                                    map from the great DrSleep of Ion Storm (lead map designer for
                                    Daikatana) and John Cash (Network guru for Id software)

        Sub-Mortal Dreams (1dx7)  - A twisted level from WeAsL. Lots of open areas, winding halls
                                    and traps to kill unsuspecting victims. Should be good for 
                                    5-8 players.

        CT: FireWater (1dx8)      - A tight level with loads of traps. Should be good for 
                                    2-4 people. 

        Chateau Gib  (1dx9)       - Redwine finished this level just in time to make the deadline
                                    He takes a break from making Single Player Levels to bring us 
                                    a medival level, with beutiful arcitecture, and some nasty
                                    suprises. 4-8 people should be perfect ;)
                                    
        Mayan Exctasy (1dx1on1)   - A quick and dirty map from map designer WeAsL. This one is
				    ment for one on one play. Any more and it will just get messy.




* 5 new runes *
 
        Ignorance Rune            - For once stupidity has it's advantages.  Special 
                                    special abilities don't work on you.  Quad,
                                    PoP, Runes, ect.  So fire away at that asshole with
                                    invulnerability, he won't know what hit him.

        Shadow Magic Rune         - Invisibility, make virtually no sound.
                                    shorts out in water... When you fire you uncloak
                                    and glow brightly.

        Gaia Magic Rune           - 100% protection from drowning, acid, lava,
                                    telefrags, and lightning discharges. 50% protection
                                    from all explosions and from lightning.

        Ressurection Rune         - When you get killed you come back to life with 
                                    all your items and such. Your killer doesn't get a 
                                    frag either...

        Necromancy Rune           - This baby is nice... Real nice... Ever wanted
                                    an army of undead soldiers? Well now's your chance!
                                    Pick this rune up and whenever you kill (but not gib)
                                    someone they turn into a zombie with whatever
                                    weapon they had when they died.  It only has 60
                                    health though and it doesn't care whats between itself
                                    and its target (so look out!).

Note: To drop a Rune Use the "droprune" command.

* 8 New Weapons *

        BFG 9000                  - What can I say? Its a the BFG
        Plasma Rifle              - Good 'ol Plasma Rifle from Doom. Lets Kick some ass!
        Cluster Bombs             - Chuck this blue grenade into a room and watch 4
                                    full sized grenades shoot out. Great for crowd control.
        Wacky Missiles            - A somewhat drunken missile... when it explodes it
                                    spawns 2 powerful homing missiles.

                                    You need to stand still for a second first though.
                                    And long reload times make this a dangerous weapon
                                    for both parties. And if you shoot into a crowd it
                                    keeps goin' until it hits a wall.
        Grappling Hook            - Umm it's the Grappling Hook... If you don't know what this
                                    is, go get CTF.
        Air Fist                  - A kick ass weapon from the Evolve team... push
                                    people AND things away! Quad Damage makes it more
                                    powerful! ;)

                                    at once. Don't try this at home kids.

* 3 New Power Ups *

        Blood Lust                - You do 4 times the damage and if you are killed but
                                    not gibbed you stay alive until Blood Lust runs out.
                                    The other player only gets a frag if you gib.

        Shub's Trinket            - It does something Random... Pick it up... and
                                    Find out.

        Torn Flesh of Souls       - Super Armor. It starts at 50 Armor. It absorbs
                                    80% of the damage you take. It Regenerates until
                                    its at the max. The maximum increases by 20 for
                                    every kill you get. Max possible is 200 armor.

* All of the Id levels reented to support DeathMatch eXtreme *

        We went ahead and re-ented all of the Id software levels to support DeathX.
        
* Plus 20 of Omega's favorite user levels *
        
        Now these may not be the best, or they may be really old, but these are the one's we picked.
        We picked these because we had fun playing with the reapers on them, or Lanning with them.
        I will continue to update this as Omega goes into the Highgorr Keep SPQ Mod, with updates 
        like ELM's maps and the BSP project, plus any really cool user maps that come along =)

                                    If you are not an admin it will then ask the other players on the
                                    server if they want to go.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
SAVE THE ZIP INTO YOUR QUAKE DIRECTORY.
In the Quake Directory type :
MD DEATHX

unzip it with these options:
PKUNZIP <filename> DEATHX

quake -game deathx

THERE, THAT'S IT!




********SERVER OPERATORS OR ANYONE WANTING TO RUN THE MOD WITH ALL OF THE WEAPONS IN THE LEVELS *********
In order to run this MOD to it's full effect with all of the weapons and items placed into all of the registered Id levels
you must follow these instructions.

        You need Qbsp.exe  and a .pak unpacker in order to do this, If you don't have any of these programs they are 
        available on our web page.

(1)Extract all of the maps in your quake/id1/pak0.pak file and quake/id1/pak1.pak file.
(2)Unzip the map file into your quake/deathx/maps/ DIR
(3)move all of the E1*.bsp, E2*.bsp, E3*.bsp, e4*.bsp, DM*.bsp, Start.bsp, and End.bsp files into your quake/deathx/maps DIR.
(4)Go into MS-DOS Prompt and into your quake/deathx/maps DIR  and use the qbsp.exe program like so.
qbsp -onlyents (Map Name), No brakets.

This will recompile all of the id levels so that they contain Death-X Map entities.
This is ONLY necessary to do if you are the server!!!

The reason's for this are simple, If we offered the registered levels for download Id would kill us :) plus it minimizes on 
file size.


*** Suggestion to Server Operators: Set your server so it will play the Death-X pak levels, and your choice of your favorite 
DM maps and your favorite NON DM levels, and not to bother with qbsp'ing the rest of the levels, Just extract the ones that
you want and Qbsp them.
