What's new in the update?

======================================================================
    Introduction
======================================================================

This is the sequel to SOUL OF EVIL, the 2002 Quake mission pack.

It is, however, totally standalone. You do not require the old SOE
to play this pack.

A Custom Quake engine is REQUIRED:

-aguirRe's GlQuake, WinQuake or NehQuake
 (see http://user.tninet.se/~xir870k/) - RECOMMENDED

-Darkplaces (see http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/) - Works,
 but there seems to be some problems with nsoe3.

-Other engines are not officially supported, but may work.

-Use of -heapsize 480000 is recommended.

======================================================================
    Installation
======================================================================

-Place all files in Quake\Nsoe, making that the folder names are
 intact.

-In Quake\Nsoe, you should have progs.dat, progs_dp.dat, pak0.pak,
 this readme file, and the folder gfx containing the folder env
 (containing skyboxes).

-IF YOU ARE USING DARKPLACES, RENAME OR REMOVE PROGS.DAT AND RENAME
 PROGS_DP.DAT TO PROGS.DAT!

-Start Quake -game nsoe

-Start a new game, and you will be taken to the SOE: Indian Summer
 start map.

-Map names are nsoe1-6 in case you want to skip from map to map -
 but they are meant to be played in sequential order, and like the
 original SOE, they are meant to depict an overall landscape, each
 map continuing to the next.

======================================================================
    Gameplay
======================================================================

-------------
  Firepower
-------------
You can expect to find most of the standard Quake guns and some more
exotic weaponry.

VORPAL SWORD:  Stronger and quicker than the axe it replaces, this
enchanted blade has a small chance per hit of instantly slaying an
enemy by decapitation.

BLASTER:
Fires bouncing lasers, much like the Laser Cannon, only not as fast.
Almost as dangerous to you as it is to the enemy.

THUNDERBOLT:
Modified from the original by firing a bolt of lightning that can
strike all targets in its path.

CHAIN THUNDERBOLT:
Fires pulses of electricity that arc from target to target.  This is
the ultimate crowd destroyer, clearing rooms like nothing else.

MIRV LAUNCHER:
Think the rocket launcher is cool, you have seen nothing yet.
This BFG-like weapon launches a large guided missile that carries
a payload of five smaller homing rockets.  To operate, hold trigger
to launch missile, look to aim and guide it, then release trigger to
unleash the payload.  Any enemy within the gun sights may be a target
for each payload rocket.  Costs five rockets per shot.

MJOLNIR:
Has more power than before, especially of the hidden kind.  Storms
may manifest when it smites the enemy in melee.  Mjolnir may also be
slammed or thrown.  To throw the hammer, hold the fire button down.

Tip: Lightning cast from enemies can hit all targets in its path too!

-------------
  Power-ups
-------------
The new powerups you may encounter include the following:

AMULET OF REFLECTION:
Erects a force field that repels all missile fire away from you.
Though a very powerful defense, you can still take damage from other
forms of attack.

ARMOR:
Now comes in five flavors; green, yellow, red, courage, and
dragonscale.  The first three remain the same.  Courage armor is a
breastplate that provides maximum protection against frontal attacks,
but offers no defense against attacks from behind.  Dragonscale is
red scaly armor that lets you morph into a small fire-breathing
dragon.  To activate dragonscale, double press the jump button.
While in dragon form, you may fly through the air much like swimming
through water.

BOOTS OF LEVITATION:
Allows the wearer to defy gravity for a limited time.  Hold jump
to float up, up, and away; then release to fall back down.

ELIXIR:
A refreshing drink... usually.

EQUALIZER:
Upgrades shotguns and nailguns by doubling their damage while cutting
the rate-of-fire in half.  This means enemies require less ammo to
kill, provided your aim is true.  Should you take another while your
guns are upgraded, your shells and nails are increased to maximum.

HEART OF DARKNESS:
Increases maximum health by 25, then heals you to your new maximum.
Lasts until the end of level.

REJUVENATOR:
Bestows unto you the power to regenerate at a rate of 50 health per
minute.  Lasts until the end of level.

TREASURE:
Found as gold coins or gems.  Coins increase armor while gems
increase health.  The boosts can exceed normal maximums.

------------
  Monsters
------------
You will find out soon enough.  However, since Soul of Evil is in a
realm of medieval fantasy, you will not find any gun-toting grunts or
robots.  You can expect to find knights, wizards, dragons, and other
foul beasts that may be appropriate in such a setting.  You will meet
many old friends, and some new horrors, who would love nothing better
than to rip your head off and offer it to their dark lord.  If you
really want to know what you are up against, read the devkit
documentation.

Tip:  Not all monsters are evil.  There are scattered pockets of
resistance fighters opposed to the enemy and will join your cause.
Also, some items may summon monsters and bind them to your will.

-------------------------------------
  Environmental Hazards and Effects
-------------------------------------
BARRELS:
The medieval version of toxic waste containers, and just as deadly.

BELLS:
Huge bells found in bell towers, which are often rung by the enemy
when they need reinforcements.  Beware when you hear the bell toll.

BOOKS:
Tomes that may relay hints to you.  To read one, simply touch it.
Some books may have multiple pages.  To access extra pages, either
press / to advance to the next page, or press a number from 1 to 8
to read the corresponding page.

CHESTS:
Ornate boxes that usually contain treasure.  However, they are always
locked, and you must break them open to reveal their contents.
Beware, not all chests contain treasure, and a few are booby-trapped
with explosives.

GLITTER:
Pretty sparkles that are harmless on their own.  They are often found
floating upward on teleporters, serving as a beacon. 

KILL ZONES:
Some areas are so deadly they simply kill whoever or whatever blunders
into their space.  Nothing, not even invulnerability or godmode will
save you.

STATUES:
Stone art in monster form.  Harmless enough, unless the monster
breaks out of its stony imprisonment.

TREES:
These are the twisted remains of the vegetation found in conquered,
war-torn lands.  They act as immobile obstacles that can block
passage for creatures and most projectiles.  Some of them may
take damage and can be destroyed.

Tip:  Some objects may be pushed around and stood on as platforms.

INDIAN SUMMER
Wilfred Campbell


Along the line of smoky hills
The crimson forest stands,
And all the day the blue jay calls
Throughout the autumn lands.

Now by the brook the maple leans
With all his glory spread,
And all the sumachs on the hills
Have turned their green to red.

Now by great marshes wrapt in mist,
Or past some river's mouth,
Throughout the long, still autumn day
Wild birds are flying south.
