QC Inventory Beta 1.0 (Feb 22 2008)

You have downloaded a bare bones project with the basics of a functioning inventory implemented taking advantage of 
Client Side QC for rendering on screen. 

- Drag containers by the border lips

- First fit bucket sorting

- Easily scalable and extendable base (improved more in the future!)

- Item area selection and size allowing for all different uniquely sized items

- Basic examples of DBShotgun and Armor interacting with inventory and ease of conversion

Requirements:

	FTEQCC compiler, takes advantage of fte arrays and preprocessor functions
