                             NOTE 

This is a big level and needs more than the standard 8 megs of memory to load.
On my machine it will run with 9 megs but i'd suggest giving it as much spare 
memmory as you got. Run Quake with the -winmem # parameter, where # is the 
amount of megs of ram your giving quake. Also I wouldn't suggest higher than 
minium resolution.

About The Code

Nathan lived with me for a couple of days and did all the code for this level.
Now he lives a couple of blocks away and you can contact him through my email 
address no problem. He too dreams of working for a video game company some day.

He did too many little fixes and patches to remember or mention here, but some 
of the ones that come to mind are:

Multiple player starts   (to use this patch in your level-just put in more than one
    normal player starts)

Ogre AI   (Ogres move in a random direction when you have the higher ground)

Fiend AI  (Fiends check their left and right edge to see if they can make a jump before 
             doing so)

Enforcer and Flying Enforcer AI  (Flying Enforcers are basically a new monster, 
             monster_enforcerfly. Both use a aiming code that compensates for circle strafeing 
             and other simple non linear movements) 

Slow Strobes  (The timing of the slow strobe light setting was changed to try and match my 
          blinking texture)

No trigger_secrets in Deathmatch

Triggers take "Not in easy" "Not in normal" etc flags

                    (This isn't a deathmatch level, its a single player level, it got to this 
                     directory by means of a long and complicated mistake)
