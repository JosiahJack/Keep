What's New - v.999 - 9/27/97
----------------------------
1.  Well, two months of hard work and nothing new to show for it,
    except a finished product of course.  :)  Now I know why games
    are delayed often, it takes a whole lot of work after you
    finish making cool new things to make it into a fun game.  A
    million and one little things have to be dealth with, decided
    upon, fixed, etc. before you have a clean polished product.
    That's what I've learned the last 2 months, I suppose.
2.  I was going to document the code more thoroughly, and comment
    more about the way things work ... but a couple things have
    changed my mind.  One being that I'm tired, out of time, and
    just don't feel like it right now.  Two, Quake2 is coming out
    very soon, and QuakeC will quickly die off ... so this code is
    not terribly useful to anyone.  If anyone has any questions, after
    thoroughly reviewing the code, feel free to send me some mail and
    I'll try and help you out.
3.  I've left in all the diary entries into this document mainly just
    for educational and entertainment value.  A lot of the stuff
    mentioned is no longer valid, or just wrong now.  Please look at
    the END of the document for correct entity descriptions, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.170 - 7/27/97
----------------------------
1.  Ugh.  There's been a million changes.  I don't think I'll try
    and list everything, just since the last progs update.
2.  Chaingun is getting pretty cool.  New name???  I put in tracer
    shots that are dynamic lights, and was able to make it so that
    it doesn't drastically slow down Quake.  You may not all like
    the effect, but I think it's pretty cool.  I also made it a
    bit stronger in DM.  oh yeah, and I also fixed other little 
    things, like it aiming too high, no kickback, etc.  Feedback?
3.  Tweaked bloodcube for DM, it does a lot less damage now.  The
    bloodcube also now sucks in gibs from the gib_fountain.  :)
4.  Debugged chain-lightning gun.  Almost done with this one.  It
    is a little less powerful in DM, and the double-hit bug (which
    is why it was REALLY too powerful) is gone.
5.  When you hit someone with the chainsaw, it slows them down to 2/3
    speed ... not sure if this will work well, lemme know.
6.  Courage armor doesn't offer 100% protection anymore, just 90%.
    I didn't get around to reflecting other weapons yet, waiting
    for more feedback.
7.  Fixed up the actor.  I'll document using him a little later.
8.  Randomly selected spawn-spots in DM!!! YAY!
9.  Fixed up some of the messages, let me know if I missed some.
10. I'm sure I've done more in the last few days, but that's the
    important stuff.  This is a pretty substantial update.  :)

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.145 - 6/15/97
----------------------------
1.  The new ME model is great.  His particle cannon is faster now,
    and he uses it a bit more often.  I achieved my goal of making
    a guy that you can't just circle strafe around picking off.
    "monster_me"
2.  The chainsaw gibs zombies, 'nuff said.  "weapon_chainsaw"
3.  The laser turret is deadly, shooting a logical spread of lasers
    that are sure to peg you.  Neat.  The classname is now "monster_lt"!
    Kandyman needs small names to keep his entity size down.
4.  All the sound code is in there, you'll get lots of errors until
    Ratmonkey gets the new sounds out.
5.  The Actor (misc_hostage) is 'sf64' compliant now.
6.  Lots of little bug fixes/tweaks.  (No more WMIW errors, bloodcube, death messages, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.140 - 6/7/97
----------------------------
1.  The Mega-enforcer is here for you guys to check out.  To put him
    in a map, use "monster_me".  His tracking side-winder missile is
    pretty cool, if I do say so myself.  It will not make 180 degree
    turns, so if you are able to dodge it then it will lose 'sight' of
    you when it passes and continue in a straight line.  He should also
    use his Particle-cannon occasionally when you are in range.  The
    force-field is as good as I can get it with particles.  The model
    could be edited to produce some other effect if you guys don't think
    the particles cut it.  Also, I removed the dynamic light from the
    missile and explosion, which makes for almost NO slowdown while
    fighting these guys.  But, should I try putting it back in on the
    explosion?
2.  The chainsaw animates all the time and plays an idle sound.  Pretty
    nice.  I also fixed the bug where picking up a backpack caused it
    to play the startup sound again.  Please report any other bugs or
    suggestions.
3.  You can put nice looking trees in your level.  Use "item_tree" and
    select a skin using a "wait" of 0 or 1.
4.  When you press '1' to abort a cut-scene, it now immediately tells
    you, "Aborting cut-scene...", and returns you to the game 1.5
    seconds later.  Much nicer.  I also applied the optimizations to
    the Zerstorer code base, man is it smooth.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.138 - 5/29/97
----------------------------
1.  Fixed up fish, now gibable and they become SOLID_NOT sooner 
    during their normal death.
2.  New enforcer attack.  Use a "wait" "1", just like for the Ogre.
    It is an Ion-splitter Model 31337. ;)  Blue and Yellow particle
    beam, 20 points damage.  They have perfect aim, but their
    reflexes are .1 seconds slow.  So you better circle strafe like
    a madman, you can actually also just run backwards to evade it.
    I may have to fix that.  Let me know what you think.
3.  Second brik_hit sound for exploding walls.  These are getting
    less cheesy, and pretty cool in SMALL quantities.  Yes Dave, you
    may have to cut back.  :)
4.  The actor is a little more scriptable, take a look at the demo
    map and dk.bsp for examples of what you can do.
5.  The Chainsaw!  '1' toggles between axe and chainsaw after you
    get it.  'weapon_chainsaw' is the classname, after we get
    a 'g_saw.mdl' to go with it.  It needs 3 sounds, 'sawidle.wav',
    'sawatck.wav', and 'sawguts.wav'.  The last is played when ripping
    into flesh.  Yummy!
6.  Camera points trigger targets when you get to them in a cut-scene.
    See the new demo map for an example, listen for kandyman's voice.
    This took me way longer then it should have, and then I thought,
    "Hey, if I would have made it so that a script-item can trigger a
    target, it would have been SOOOO much easier, and actually more
    useful since the scripts can be timed however you want."  Ugh.  I
    need to think before I code.  :(  I may go back and do it that
    way later.  What do you think?
7.  I can detect if the player is using glquake, and am fixing the
    rain sprites to fit which game is playing.  This really made me
    smile.  :)  Has anyone ever used the console command 'gl_cull'?
    I'm counting on noone changing it from the default value, because
    that's how I check if glquake is running.  I may try and find an
    even more obscure glquake-only console command to do the check with.
    Any suggestions?
8.  New trog magic-ball-explosion model.  I love the swirl of small
    fire around the ball, in fact, I wish it was all a swirl of small
    fire pieces.  heh, Ok, so maybe not ALL, but at least some more.
    Please Rig, pretty please?
9.  I feel like I'm forgetting something.  I'm sure there are a few
    bugs to be found, and lots of tweaking, so let me know what you
    think.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.135 - 5/17/97
----------------------------
1.  Added all the new stuff that Rig has been doing.  There are now
    real entities for the chain-lightning gun and the stun_gun.
    (weapon_chainlightning, weapon_stunner)  I also tightened up
    the code integrating them into id's weapon system, but I'm not
    completely finished just yet.  I'm still fine-tuning the weapons
    so suggestions are extremely welcome.
2.  I included the new models and sound, just to make sure everyone has 
    the same copies and stuff.  Put 'stunfire.wav' in './sound/weapons/'.
3.  The troglodyte is expecting to use his own sounds, so you'll get
    lots of errors until Ratmonkey sends them out.  I hear he's working 
    on them now.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.130 - 5/15/97
----------------------------
1.  SF64 monsters are finished, and pretty damn good if I can take
    a minute to toot my own horn.  :)  Only change:  if you want
    the monster to simulate teleporting in, put a "style" "1".
2.  Buzzsaw Ogre!  Give a normal Ogre a "wait" "1" and he will shoot
    three blades at you instead of a grenade.  Play around him and
    see if he is accurate enough, or too accurate.  Suggestions are
    also welcome, and he could use a modified skin also.
3.  Actor-bot.  A very basic bot whose actions are scriptable.  He
    was designed for cut-scenes, but will be used by Killme in 'MM'.
    When triggered, the bot's behavior will cease to be scripted, and
    it will become an enemy.  A mindless Quake enemy (id AI), not a
    ReaperBot or anything.  I'll save my attempt at AI for a real
    monster that we'll add, like that wizard guy Rig got from qtest.
    I'll provide instructions on using the Actor-bot after he is
    more complete, for now just see 'DK.bsp'.
4.  The troglodyte is here in pre-alpha form.  His AI is stolen from
    the 'wizard/scrag' so he is pretty stupid right now.  But you
    can check out my first attempts at his attacks.  I'm sure Rig
    will want to make a cool animated flaming fireball to replace
    my eyeball, and perhaps other things as well.  Ratmonkey needs
    to get cranking on some killer sounds, evil chanting and magical
    effect sounds.
5.  The chain-lightning gun has been tweaked a bit.  Give it a run.
6.  There's a new map, DK.bsp, to showcase some of the new stuff
    in the devkit.  I was really sick of seeing acs.bsp, so I made
    this one a little prettier.  It has some actor/drones and a 
    couple troglodytes.
7.  There are some things I did specifically for MM, like the
    teleporter that sends monsters and players to different places,
    and the actor AI, which shouldn't be needed in other maps.  Let
    me know if you have any questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.127 - 4/12/97
----------------------------
1.  The stun gun plasma projectile now bounces off walls and will
    explode when it hits something after 5 seconds have passed, or
    when it hits a living object.  Neato.
2.  SF64 monsters!!  Replaces teleporting monsters.  Just put a
    monster where you would like it to eventually show up, and give
    it a "spawnflags" "64", and a targetname.  When it is triggered
    it will magically appear.  It is silent by default, but if you
    want the teleport flash and noise, give it a "dmg" "1".
3.  I increased the Bloodcubes attack rate when you're running
    around.  It is much more helpful against the Shamblers at the
    bottom of GYG now.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.125 - 4/6/97
----------------------------
1.  The Stun-Gun!!  There are a couple ways you can test this new
    weapon.  You can use it as a normal weapon, by binding '9' to
    "impulse 254" (console> bind 9 "impulse 254").  This will make
    the number '9' select the stun gun, like all other weapons.  The
    Stun-gun currently uses rockets for some reason.  You can also
    bind a key to "impulse 41", and that will fire a stun plasma.
    When the plasma ball hits a monster, it will freeze in it's tracks
    until it is attacked.  It will stay frozen forever if you like, I
    could have also made it so that it just froze for 5-seconds, and
    then contiunued what it was doing.  Which is better??
    To see what happens when a player gets hit, walk up to a wall and
    shoot it.  :)  If you are in developer mode, or playing with an
    old version of Quake (older than 1.07), you will get some debug
    messages while playing with the stun gun.
2.  func_frames are back in for Ace_Dave.
3.  That's it, hot dammit!

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.120 - 3/31/97
----------------------------
1.  Silent teleporting:  if a teleporter is given a "spawnflags" "8"
    then it will transport the entity to the destination without
    making a sound or a particle flash.  Good for placing monsters
    somewhere without it seeming like they teleported in.
2.  Particle Streams!  Watch the statues when you push the button
    in that room, I put some streams above them.  Docs are at the
    END of the entity list at the bottom of this document.
3.  Increased range of chained lightning, and tweaked the lightning
    positioning.
4.  Learned how to use Hipnotic rotation.  Put new stuff in Acs.bsp.
5.  uhm...I'm pretty sure I tweaked other stuff, I think I rewrote
    some of the bloodcube timing stuff that was left over from the
    old gameplay type.  So if you notice anything weird, let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.115 - 3/21/97
----------------------------
1.  A trigger_quake can now be started by triggering it.  Thanks
    to Kandyman for the suggestion.
2.  Hipnotic triggerable sound entities.  Documented below.
3.  Monster statues!  courtesy of Ace_Dave!  There are three statues
    right now, Fiend, Shambler, and Hellknight (2 poses).  To make a
    monster a statue, give it a "spawnflags" "2", and for the second
    Hellknight pose use "4".  You may target a statue, and when it
    is triggered the monster will come to life.
4.  A bit of bug fixing and stuff thoughout code base.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.111 - 3/15/97
----------------------------
1.  Hipnotic Rotation!  Be cautious with the power you now wield.
    The trigger_hurt is also from Hipnotic now as well.  Please
    read Hipnotic's instructions on these things, for I have not 
    had time to play with them.
2.  The trigger_quake will trigger all targets when a level starts
    during Deathmatch play.  For an example of why this is important
    play ACS.bsp in Deathmatch with a previous devkit.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.110 - 3/13/97
----------------------------
1.  For Dave:  Zombie spawnflags "8" will spawn a crucified zombie that
    does not move around, and also, if you have a sleeping zombie
    that you want to stay asleep until triggered, add a "wait" "1"
    to it, and of course give it a targetname to be triggered.
    There is an example in the gravity room of acs.bsp.
2.  Chain-Lightning Gun!  You get one when you pick up a normal
    lightning gun (for now), or do an Impulse 9 (Dr. Rig should know
    about that :).  Press '8' a second time to select the chain-gun.
    If someone wants to make a new model or something, do it.  You
    shoot out a 50 Volt charge, and it loses 5 Volts every time it
    chains to an enemy.  So you have the potential to harm 10 enemies
    per shot, with the last enemy taking 5 damage points.  Comments?
3.  Tele-attack testing.  The shambler has the ability to detect 
    incoming projectiles, and teleport directly behind you, or in
    front of you.  The shambler is not a good monster to have done
    this to, because it has long attack sequences, and it won't
    teleport in the middle of an attack.  I think it would be cool
    to have an end boss like this, but have the attack sequence be
    shorter.  That way, you'd have to time it perfectly to hit the boss
    just as he was attacking, and if you were too late or early, he 
    would teleport right behind you.  That would (finally) be a 
    challenging boss.  One bad mofo.
4.  The func_frames have the same sound support that the func_trains
    have.  Much better, but I'm thinking func_frames may be obselete.
    I am okay with putting a SMALL bit of rotating doors, etc. in ACS,
    but not continuous rotating trains, etc.  So if you want rotation
    merged in, and improved, let me know.  You guys are the boss.
    I'm not putting in bobbing water though, I have to draw the line
    on wasted cycles somewhere.  :)
5.  I'm pretty sure I did other things, (oh yeah, the bloodcube has
    totally reworked gameplay), but I can't remember anything else
    right now.  Enjoy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.105 - 3/5/97
----------------------------
1.  For Killme:  Zombie spawnflags "4" will spawn a dead zombie, and
    a 'misc_hostage' spawnflags "1" will spawn a player character
    that will stand in place.  Neither can be damaged/killed.
2.  Dark-angel Wings!  The ogre head near the hostage is the .mdl
    right now for the wings. Press spacebar to flap them.  You fly
    in the direction you are looking, so look up to fly high.
    It'll need a .mdl.  Impulse 40 to cheat.
3.  Courage Armor!  100% protection from damage while it lasts.
    Rockets give half-damage on impact, grenades bounce off, nail 
    reflect right back at you -> if you are hit in the chest.  If 
    you are shot in the back, it is like you're not even wearing armor.
    This is all subject to change.  Try it, let me know what you think.
    Needs a .mdl.  Impulse 41 to cheat.
4.  The trigger_push can be targeted.  If targeted, it will start out
    OFF, and will turn ON after being triggered.  The trigger_gravity
    works the same way, and they both will TOGGLE if triggered
    repeatedly.
5.  For Kandy:  Implemented Newton's Laws of Motion.  If you shoot
    while in the air, you are pushed back a little.  It varies
    depending on what you are shooting.  Kandy also suggested that the
    amount that a creature is pushed back by getting shot should
    be increased, but I haven't done it yet.  What is you guys
    opinion on that?
6.  The bloodcube should work properly with levels with more than
    one bloodcube in them now.  It used to get confused about sucking
    the gibs.  I think I fixed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.101 - 2/26/97
----------------------------
1.  You may change the speed of a func_train after each path_corner in
    its path.  The train reads the "speed" value of the corner it is
    about to go to.  Place the speed value on the corner that the
    train will be APPROACHING.  Geez, what a redundant explanation.
2.  The gib_fountain!  Most of the work was done by Ace_Dave.  You
    place a misc_fireball, and give it a "spawnflags" of "2".  Also,
    if targeted the fountain won't start until triggered.
3.  The exploding wall will now explode when triggered.  I don't
    feel so bad about using the exploding wall anymore, for I went
    through and rewrote most of it.  :)
4.  Fixed one of Kandyman's problems with the CCK.  I will probably
    do a full-scale professional rewrite of the CCK before we are
    through.  It is good right now, but I want it bullet-proof.
    (since writing the above, I have started the rewrite of the CCK,
    and it is much more solid now.)
5.  Fixed up some of the entity documentation.  Make sure you read it,
    because some things may have changed and not been mentioned up here.
6.  I almost forgot, the bloodcube teleports with you (sorta) so you
    don't lose the poor fellow anymore.  He will also stay with you
    through cut-scenes, but I haven't suspended time for him (like I
    did for the other power-ups) yet.  I had a good birthday: good
    mexican food, spent some time with my family and girlfriend, and
    did some QuakeC coding - all in one day.  Who could ask for anything
    more?
7.  Oh yeah, I'm scrapping the spear.  It will never work perfectly with
    Quake.  You'd need perfect collision detection for it to look good,
    and we just don't have that in Quake.  It's one of the VERY FEW
    things I can gripe about.  :)

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.100 - 2/21/97
----------------------------
1.  Updated documentation with list of all modified entities.
2.  Triggers that must be triggered before they are triggerable. 
	("spawnflags" "2")
3.  New sounds for func_train.  Sounds 2-5 correspond with the sounds
    for func_door sounds 1-4.
4.  func_train hurt-on-touch now hurts player even if he isn't moving.
    A consequence of this is that the func_train is not solid, so you
    may need me to put it back to the old way.  If the "dmg" is high,
    then the player is repelled from func_train when hit, and will die
    before ever being able to tell that the train is not solid.  Play
    with it.  ("spawnflags" "1")
5.  Teleporters can be made to teleport you to random locations!  See
    end of document for instructions. 
6.  func_train can be a teleporter!  You may either target a teleport
    destination using the "netname" field, or it can be a random teleporter.
7.  The spear is included in this devkit.  You must have rockets, and
    the nailgun to use it.  Press '4' twice to activate it.  There are
    serious bugs, so don't expect much.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
What's New - v.099 - 2/15/97
----------------------------
1.  BloodCube has a bit of intelligence when moving now.  It won't go
    through walls quite as much now, not perfect, but a lot better.
2.  BloodCube has a whole new Attack method.  No more lightning.  I wrote
    a brand new effect, the particle stream, just for this.  Cool.
3.  If a func_train hits a corner with a "wait" of "-1", it will stop and
    wait to be triggered.  When triggered, it will continue to the next
    corner point.  Killme, go make your elevator.  :)
4.  Check out the ACS map for examples of almost everything.
5.  Coming soon - The crucify spear!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.098 - 2/10/97
----------------------------
1.  Ace_Dave added the following:
    a. Silent push brush  ("spawnflags" "2")
    b. Lightning styles  (Light styles 15,16,17)
	and a good random thunder sound effect. ("ambient_thunder")
    c. Rain Mod from QuakeX  ("func_rain" and "ambient_rain")
    d. Sleeping zombies  ("spawnflags" "2")
    e. Exploding walls  ("exploding_wall")
	Give the wall a "health" that you want it take to destroy it,
	and you may target other things to happen when the wall breaks.

Please direct any questions about these mods to Ace_Dave, as I have not had
time to adequately test them.

2.  "trigger_gravity":  I wasn't happy with the gravity change code,
it just wasn't good enough.  But it did get me thinking, and
convinced me that there had to be a better way.  Of course there was, 
now you place a trigger like a water brush.  If you want a room to have 
a different gravity, fill the ENTIRE room with the "trigger_gravity" 
brush.  To specify the gravity, just put a "gravity" field in the trigger 
with the value you want.
It should work well in both single and multi-player games now.  :)

3.  The BloodCube:  The cube is now up to a solid BETA status.  Most of the
code has been rewritten since the demo I gave all of you.  I will talk later
about the specifics of the Cube, which are always in motion.

4.  ACS.BSP has been updated with examples of the lightning light and sound
(we need a more menacing thunder sound), an exploding wall, the Bloodcube
(no, it won't go through the teleporter), it is now multi-player friendly.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

What's New - v.095 - 2/2/97
--------------------
1.  func_train can now take a spawnflag of '1'.  This will make the
train hurt you on 'touch'.  The player must be moving towards the
train for it to hurt them.  

2.  func_plat can now take a spawnflag of '2'.  This will make it a
toggle-only platform.  You must trigger the platform for it to move,
I used a shootable button in my test-level.  The platform will stay
in it's current state (UP or DOWN) until triggered.

3.  You can now link a trigger_camera to a couple of trigger_cvarsets.
The CVARs will change for the cut-scene, and then automatically go back
to their original values at the end of the cut-scene.  I used this to
change 'fov' and 'v_idlescale' on one of the cut-scenes in the test-level
to produce a nightmare like vision.  Yes, the trigger_camera is also 
linked to the first camera of the CS.

4.  True gib physics!!!!!  Inspired by Hipnotic, and prodded by Killme,
I set out to put realistic physics into the gib code, and about 15
minutes later, voila!  A truly satisfying experience.  I spent the next
hour and a half just blowing up the new respawning hostage I stuck in
the test level.  ;)  It is so cool to toss a grenade behind him, and
have the gibs come flying at you like they should.  (make sure you hit
the player/hostage with a few shotgun blasts first, so that you get a
high-velocity gib)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
What's New - v.092 - 1/26/97
--------------------
     If you add a 'delay' field to cameras with a value of "1", the
camera will not track the focal_point while moving.  (You can set a
new focal point for that camera however, see the 3rd scene in acs.map)
     I added support for func_frame animation, using Matt Houser's rip-
off of dimensionality's frames.  I modified it just slightly to fix a
bug or two.  I put a VERY nice looking rotating door in acs.map!
Look at acs.map and frames.qc for instructions.  One of the fixes I did
was to make the final animation frame NOT solid, so now you can use the
func_frames as a door, and not worry about the screwed up bounding box.
You will have to make sure the final animation frame (the one that you
want it stop at) is not in a place that the player would walk through.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

			* Overview *

     First, cut-scenes will only activate in single-player.
During multiplayer, the triggers are removed.  A level made with
cut-scenes will play fine without the progs.dat, but the player will
receive a bunch of errors when starting the level.  Similar to
starting a CTF map without running its progs.dat.
     The progs.dat included allows for cut-scenes to be designed
into custom levels.  The level-designer places a trigger in the
level, and when the player touches it he/she is transported to a
camera entity in the level.  Multiple cameras can be placed, and linked
to form a moving camera.  Each camera in the chain can have a 'wait' and
'speed'.  'wait' is how long the camera will remain still at that point,
and 'speed' is the speed of the camera as it APPROACHES THIS point.
You now also place a focal point that you want the camera to face.  
Each camera that you place in a chain can have a different focal point
that it will face as it APPROACHES THAT point.  You may also specify
that a camera NOT focus on the focal point while moving.  You may now
also change any CVAR that you want to for the cut-scene.
     Script entities are placed in the level and their message keys are 
displayed during the cut-scene.  The player remains in camera mode until 
the last script is displayed.  The player then returns to the game in 
the same condition as they were when they left.

This comes straight from acs.map:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
// *** Scripts remain the same.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                 * General Operating Instructions *

	The trigger_camera and the info_movie_camera are linked just as
you would normally link objects, such as teleports with their destination.
If you link the first camera to another camera, the camera will move to
that point at the 'speed' you gave on the second camera.  You can string
as many cameras along as you wish, and the camera will automatically stop
when it hits the last one.  You can change the speed at each camera, or if 
you don't put a 'speed' on consecutive cameras it will keep its current 
speed.  If you place a "delay" field with a value of "1", the camera
will not track the focal-point while moving.  See third cut-scene in
the acs.map.  
	You can also target any number of 'trigger_cvarset'
entities to take effect during the cut-scene.  The original values of
the CVARs will be returned at the end of the cut-scene automatically.
	The view tracking can be a bit jerky if the camera is moving
slowly and perpindicular to the focal-point.  You'll have to fool around 
with directions and 'speed' to find a good smooth path.
	The trigger_camera also starts the script sequence, by naming the 
first script and the duration to display it (in seconds).  The cut-scene is
exited only by reaching a script with a '0' in the "next_script" field.
If you want no scripts during the scene, or want to pause with a blank
screen between scripts, just put a info_script in the sequence that has
a "message" as "".  The operation is pretty straight-forward.
	No model is placed where the player was, it would be simple to do,
but I didn't need to.  It only would be needed if you wanted a cut-scene
that showed the main character standing in place.   :)
	If monsters are attacking the player when he hits the trigger_camera
they will continue to move towards him as a camera, but they will not
attack it.  They will just run around it looking kind of nervous.  You
can link a monster to the trigger, and the trigger will not work until
the monster has been killed.  I placed my cameras in areas that the player
had not been to already to make extra certain that no leftover monsters
were running towards the camera.  Monsters that have not seen you already
will NOT mistakingly target the camera during a cut-scene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
		 * New and Modified Entities *

Listed here are the entity descriptions taken straight from the source
code.  I'm not going to repeat the cut-scene entities, because they have
already been addressed in this document.  These descriptions are in 
Carmack's QuakeEd format, so if you are using that editor (or Thunder - 
the editor I'm waiting for), then you get all of this within the editor.
 :)  If you are unfamiliar with the format, let me go through an example:

/*QUAKED entity_classname (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 32) ? SF1 SF2 SF4 SF8 SF16
Description, along with "field" listing.  The entity_classname is what
you put in the "classname" field when placing the entity.  The numbers in
parentheses have to do with the size, and may be used by QuakeEd when
drawing a box to represent the entity, ignore them.  There is sometimes
a question mark after the last set of numbers, I don't know why, ignore it.
After that are a list of SPAWNFLAGS options.  The first one listed is
selected by placing a value of "1" in the "spawnflags" field when placing
an entity.  Each subsequent option number is an appropriate multiple of 2.
So the sixth option would be "spawnflags" "32".  You can select multiple spawn functions by adding up the numbers, so if you want SF2 and SF8, then you would place a "spawnflags" "10" in the entity.
*/

Now to the real entities:

/* ------------------------------ */
/* |	  trigger_cvarset		  | */
/* ------------------------------ */
/*QUAKED trigger_cvarset (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 32)
You can set any CVAR in a cutscene with this trigger.  Put the CVAR name
in "netname", the value in "message", and the ORIGINAL value in "script".  
Useful CVAR's are sv_gravity, sv_friction, fov, and v_idlescale.
*/

/* ------------------------------ */
/* |	   trigger_gravity 	  | */
/* ------------------------------ */
/*QUAKED trigger_gravity (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 32)
This will change the gravity for objects that are inside it.
Put the value to change gravity to in the "gravity" field.
Ziggurat Vertigo used '100' for its low gravity.
*/

/* ------------------------------ */
/* |	   trigger_quake		  | */
/* ------------------------------ */
/*QUAKED trigger_quake (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 32)
Starts an earthquake.  Players view will shake for amount of time you
put in "wait".  Place the richter scale of the quake in the "dmg" field.
It will also trigger all targets like a 'trigger_once'.
*/

Lava Balls and Gib Fountain.  "speed" field for vertical velocity.  If
a "targetname" is given, the fountain/fireball will remain dormant until
it is triggered.

GIB_FOUNTAIN(2) causes the fireball to be a random gib piece, and occasionally it will spit out an entire player amount of gibs. 
*/

------------
/*QUAKED func_rain (0.3 0.1 0.6) (-10 -10 -8) (10 10 8)

-----------------------
/*QUAKED monster_zombie (1 0 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32) Crucified ambush/sleeping

If crucified, stick the bounding box 12 pixels back into a wall to look right.

ambush/sleeping (2) is Ace_Dave's sleeping zombie mod.
*/

-----------------------------------------------------------
/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ? PLAT_LOW_TRIGGER PLAT_TOGGLE
speed	default 150

Plats are always drawn in the extended position, so they will light 
correctly.  If the plat is the target of another trigger or button, 
it will start out disabled in the extended position until it is trigger, 
when it will lower and become a normal plat.  If the "height" key is set, 
that will determine the amount the plat moves, instead of being implicitly 
determined by the model's height.  

PLAT_TOGGLE(2) will force the platform to be triggered to move between states.

Set "sounds" to one of the following:
1) base fast
2) chain slow
*/

---------------------
/***  func_train ***/
---------------------
/*QUAKED func_train (0 .5 .8) ? TRAIN_TOUCH TRAIN_TELEPORTER
Trains are moving platforms that players can ride.
The targets origin specifies the min point of the train at each corner.
The train spawns at the first target it is pointing at.
If the train is the target of a button or trigger, it will not begin 
moving until activated.  You may now also put a "speed" field on a
path_corner, and the train will travel that speed when APPROACHING that
point.  

TRAIN_TOUCH(1) will cause the train to hurt the player on touch.
TRAIN_TELEPORTER(2) will make a teleporter out of the train.  If you want to
 target a specific destination, use the "netname" field to target it. Or,
 if you want to use random teleport destinations, you MUST USE a "spawnflags"
 of "6" on the func_train.  This will make it a random teleporter.

speed:	default 100
dmg:	default	2
sounds:

1) ratchet metal
2) stone
3) base
4) stone chain
5) screechy metal
*/

--------------------------------------------------------
/*QUAKED trigger_multiple (.5 .5 .5) ? NOTOUCH TRIGGERED
Variable sized repeatable trigger.  Must be targeted at one or more 
entities.  If "health" is set, the trigger must be killed to activate 
each time.  If "delay" is set, the trigger waits some time after activating 
before firing.  "wait" : Seconds between triggerings. (.2 default) If 
notouch is set, the trigger is only fired by other entities, not by 
touching.  

NOTOUCH(1) has been obsoleted by trigger_relay!
TRIGGERED(2) causes the trigger to be inactive until it is triggered by
 another entity.

/*QUAKED info_teleport_random (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 32)
This is a random destination marker for a RANDOM teleporter.
*/

-------------------------
/*QUAKED trigger_teleport (.5 .5 .5) ? PLAYER_ONLY SILENT RANDOM STEALTH
Any object touching this will be transported to the corresponding 
info_teleport_destination entity. You must set the "target" field, 
and create an object with a "targetname" field that matches. 

If the trigger_teleport has a targetname, it will only teleport entities 
when it has been fired.

SILENT(2) eliminates the teleporter ambient noise (good for hidden monster teleporters.
RANDOM(4) causes the teleporter to send the player to a random destination
 among the info_teleport_random markers in the level.  You MUST place a
 "count" field that is the number of info_teleport_random entities you
 placed.
STEALTH(8) eliminates the particle flash and noise when an entity is teleported.
