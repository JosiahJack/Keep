(update version 1.1 -- fixed the crash when the game attempted to play
the included demos, caused by missing precaches)

Rubicon 2 is a new Quake experience with three large single-player levels,
plus a custom mod featuring new enemies, sounds, textures, mapmodels,
hazards, and more. It should run with any Quake engine, but for the optimal
experience I recommend Fitzquake (http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake) or any
derivative engine such as Quakespasm or RMQ.

The ideal engine for this mod would support overbright lighting, fullbrights,
per-entity alpha, and worldspawn fog. In addition, engines that fix the 
large model culling bug and the pink edges on sprites bug will be better.

I plan to release textures, source code, map files, etc. soon.  Keep an eye
on celephais.net for news.

* Installation Instructions *

Unzip pak0.pak and rubicon2.txt into the quake/rubicon2/ directory. Start
quake with the "-game rubicon2" switch, and choose 'new game' from the menu.

* New Monsters *

DREADNAUGHT
Armed with a flamethrower and enough fuel to torch a small city, the
dreadnaught can do more damage at close range than any other enemy. Keep your
distance and you should be safe. If you do catch fire, dive into the nearest
water, pick up a health pack, or simply wait -- the fire will eventually burn
out. Wearing a biosuit helps, too.

CENTURION
The centurion’s flying platform allows him to overtake targets quickly, but
his high-powered nailgun is dangerous even at a distance. Some centurions
have learned to exploit the experimental technology of the flying platform to
"phase" through solid matter. It is not currently known how this works.

AUTOMATON
These security robots were commonly nicknamed "Floyd" becayse of the FLD
model designation. Their corroded metal brains are not sophisticated enough
to understand fear, hesitation, or doubt. Be careful -- each automaton is
powered by a primitive atomic core that will explode if breached! On the
other hand, that could be useful...

* New Entities *

LADDERS
Walk up to a ladder and hold the "jump" button to climb. Turn away from the
ladder to let go and fall.

BREAKABLE PANELS
Keep an eye out for damaged panels and grates -- they could be hiding a
secret area!

SECURITY LASERS
Lasers are impassible barriers, used to block off secure zones. Each laser
control circuit uses a different color code. When you switch off a specific
circuit, all lasers of the same color will be disabled.

STEAM VENTS
High-pressure steam vents spew deadly vapor. Use a valve to seal off the vent
before proceeding.

TURRETS
Armored turrets that track your position. They cannot be damaged directly.
Find another way to disable them.
