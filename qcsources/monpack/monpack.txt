* Overall *
-----------
Quake C      : yes
New Sounds   : yes (a bunch + more)
New MDL      : yeah, a shitload
                - New monsters
                - New weapons
QC Files     : No (mail me if you want them, though)
New BSP      : Nope



* Description *
---------------
This patch adds several new monsters to the game, as well as two new weapons.
(This patch is probably one of the first add-ons to contain this many new monsters, 
than most Quake -C modifications, I must add). Not only that, but I basacally improved
some of the new monster's sounds (ones that never had any new sounds to begin with).

	The new monsters featured in this version are:

		- Bazooka Babe 
		- Blarg
		- Chthon Scrag
		- Drone
		- Gremlin
		- Lava Man
		- Manga Babe
		- Snakeman
		- Willy The Spider 

	The new weapons are:
		
		- Gatling Gun
		- Flame Thrower (my new version)

				*note: The Phantom Swordsman was supposed to be included in 
				       this version, but I didn't get a chance to configure
				       it, so I'll just wait until version 2.0 to add him.
				       


* Improvements *
----------------

- The Flame Thrower is now just strong enough to gib Zombies
- The Chthon Scrag was too powerful before, so I lowered it's energy a bit
- The Spider has two new sounds - when it fires its venom, and when you shoot it
- The Snakeman has three new sounds - when its idle, when it spots you, and when it dies
- The Manga Babe's "WAAAAA-HA!!" sound has been taken out, because it sounded really stupid
- The Drone will make a "bleep-bleep" sound when it spots you (since it had no sight sound before)
- There is a death notification (eg: Player was shot by a Grunt) for each fo the new monsters
- There is a new console/startup background



* How it works *
----------------

 - The Blarg replaces some of the Fiends
 - The Chthon Scrag replaces some of the regular Scrags (mostly all)
 - Drones replace some of the Enforcers
 - The Snakeman and the Spider replace all of the Ogres
 - The Spider also replaces some of the Tarbabys (aka:Spawn)
 - The Lava Man replaces some of the Shamblers
 - The Bazooka Babe replaces some Death Knights, and some Enforcers too
 - The Manga Babe replaces some of the Grunts, and some knights too 
 - Gremlins replace some of the Zombies, and some of the khights too	

 - The Gatling Gun replaces all Supder Nailguns
 - The Flame Thrower replaces all Grenade Launchers



* Installation *
----------------
Make a directory in your Quake folder called "monpack".
Then, unzip the file in that directory.
After that, run:

	c:\quake\quake -game monpack
	
		If it all worked correctly, you should see a new 
		startup (console) screen, as well as a new demo.



* Coming up in the next version *
--------------------------------------------
In the next version I'll include these new monsters:
		
		- The Phantom Swordsman (was previously intended for this version)
		- The Goblin (possibly a new, and better skin)
		- Cyberdemon (I hope someone will give it a better skin)
		- The Dragon (with a killer new skin from Rogue's version)
		- The Electric eel

Also, I'll include these new weapons:

		- The Plasma Gun (Doom version, WILL add better sounds)
		- Proximety Mines
		- Possibly a whole lot more, as I find the QC files
