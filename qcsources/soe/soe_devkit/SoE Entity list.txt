ARENA MODE ENTITIES:

func_spawn - give a func_spawn the targetname "DMSP_boss" and in Arena games this monster (in SOE Arena, a Dragon) will
appear as a 'boss' at the end of the level.
info_dmsp_spawn - an entity which functions, in addition to info_player_deathmatch, as a spawnspot for monster in arena
mode. Basically, place these to increase the chances of monsters spawning in a certain area - they are not mandatory.

CUT SCENE ENTITIES:

see cutscenes.txt

MISCELLANEOUS:

func_exploder - creates explosions. from Scourge of Armagon, explanation can be found in entity section at The Forge
(http://www.planetquake.com/worldcraft)
func_spawn and func_spawn_small - also from Scourge, a much better way of spawning items and enemies. Also see the Forge.
misc_corpse - a corpse. not used much.
misc_explobox - replaced with a medieval barrel
misc_meat - a pile of gibs. doggies like it.
misc_tree - set a key 'cnt.' the values 0, 1, or 2 set the type of tree.


MONSTER CHANGES:

monster_dog - dogs will munch on misc_meat if present instead of attacking the player (used in soe1m2).
monster_army - replaced by a lesser Goblin
monster_enforcer - replaced by a larger Goblin
monster_shambler - setting a key 'skin' to '1' results in the black shamblers seen in soe2m5. spawnflag 2 (value 4)
adds the explosive attacks.
monster_demon1 - setting a key 'skin' to '1' results in the black fiends seen in soe2m5.
monster_knight - some will randomly be tougher with different skins.
monster_hell_knight - spawnflag 2 (value 4) gives him more health and fireball attack; skins are 0)silver 1)hell lord 2)bane
monster_wizard - unless 'skin' is set to '1', you will get a "drake" - green skin. setting skin to 1 returns to default skin.


NEW ITEMS:

item_dragon - summons a dragon to fight for you, in SP or DM.


NEW MONSTERS::

monster_acolyte - least powerful variety of magician
monster_sorceror - mid-level magician

monster_trogboss - the end boss as seen in soe2m5
monster_troglodyte - a 'normal' variation of the trogboss (not used in soe).
monster_bane - episode one end boss as seen in soe1m5
monster_dragon - requires a lot more explanation. see dragons.txt


NEW SOUNDS:

all ambient sounds have been altered, as well as the secret sound. Additionally there are a few other sounds, such as
random_wind.


SETTING GAMEPLAY MODES:

Default mode is Quest. To set Arena mode, you will need a special trigger_changelevel with spawnflag 2 (value 4) set.


VARIOUS TRICKS:

ladders - simply brushwork covered with tiny invisible stairs (use the 'clip' brush).
readable items - although you can use trigger_read, for shorter things we just used trigger_once or trigger_multiple.
scrolling text - simply a cut-scene with a func_door in front of it. The func_door uses a texture which has the text on it.
                 You will need two triggers to start this - a trigger_camera to start the cut-scene, and a trigger_once to
                 start the door moving.
