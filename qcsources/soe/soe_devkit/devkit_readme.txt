*** Soul Of Evil devkit ****
Development stuff for the Quake mod 'Soul Of Evil'



This devkit is just basically intended to get those of you started who are interested in making additional Soul Of Evil maps.
Included are three text documents which cover Soul Of Evil's new entities - one for Dragons, one for Cut-scenes, and one for
everything else, including new effects and monsters. Besides this there are the textures from Soul Of Evil - Autumn.wad 
contains all those textures used in the soe1mx maps, Subterra.wad contains those textures used in soe2mx maps, and arena.wad
contains the textures from the deathmatch maps. This should be what you need to get started. If you want additional support,
map sources, prefabs, advice, help, or whatever else, Tronyn will happily provide it (mailto:netgames@netdp.com).
