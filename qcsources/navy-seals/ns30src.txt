Ok, here is the source code for Navy Seals 3.0

  Everything is in here, including the Squad Bots.  I've also included 
the ProQCC compiler by Lee Smith.  If you have a different compiler you
like to use, go ahead and use it, but regular QCC chokes and dies tryin
to compile this much code.  If you want to make changes to the game, you
will need to unpak the Pak0.pak file with a program like WinPak or QPED.
If you have any questions with the code, feel free to e-mail me and I will
try to help you out as best I can.  

If someone reading this is wanting to take this a step further, some things 
I feel it could use are a couple new enemies, and maybe some new weapons, 
like explosives or something.  Also, a QuakeWorld version would be nice. 
(I wanted to do this, but since I've had my computer back I have been just 
too busy to try to get it started)  But most of all, just have fun with this! =)
