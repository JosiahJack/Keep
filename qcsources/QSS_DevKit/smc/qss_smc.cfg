//thanks to smc's quake.rc/smc_config.cfg files fucking over user settings, you should edit smc's quake.rc to exec this file after smc_config.cfg. renaming this file to autoexec.cfg will NOT work (at least not fully). alternatively you can just manually exec this file every single fucking time you start smc.
//WARNING: to run smc, you will need to extract the pk3 file first (pk3 is just a renamed zip, so you should be able to open with most programs like 7zip or rar or whatever)
