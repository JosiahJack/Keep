wad -t QPIC ./gfx.wad ./*grapple.pcx

If wad is not recognized, ensure that qcli (Joshua Skelly's
Quake-CLI tools) is installed and on the path, e.g.:
export PATH=/home/qmaster/.local/bin:$PATH

Replace ./*grapple.pcx with file(s) of choice to add just the newly added/updated ones

Make sure to copy and paste gfx.wad from keep/gfxsrc/gfx.wad (alongside this readme) into keep/gfx.wad
