5+s|trigger_victory
5+|Point
5+|Drake
5+|Automatically fires its targets when the last enemy has been killed in a map.  Does not require targetname.
|target `REQUIRED`|string 3+|The name of the object(s) to have run the `use` function on.
5+|same for target2, target3, target4, statetarget1, statetarget2,...statetarget24
|killtarget|string 3+|The name of the object(s) to delete from the world.
5+|same for killtarget2.

5+s|trigger_monsterpassivestate
5+|Point
5+|Arcane Dimensions
5+|Toggle passive state on targetted monster(s).
|targetname `REQUIRED`|string 3+|The name of this entity for use by an activator.
|target `REQUIRED`|trilean 3+|The name of the object(s) to change the 
`passive_state` on.  Must be alive, a monster, not be marked
with spawnflag to spawn angry, not have `passive_state` of -1
(NEVER), not be insane `temperament`, not be marked with 
`ryuflags` 4096 for forced to shoot, and not have `alignment`
of 1 (Good).  Will run targets on `passive_eventon` or
`passive_eventoff` if set on any monsters that this affects;
this is used to run these targets when passive is activated or
deactivated for that individual monster.  Useful to use
the monster as its own trigger_relay to reset stuff on change.
|state|int|[-1,0,1,2]|0|The value to set `passive_state` on targeted enemy.
All of the following have the potential to put target
into Reset state if they already have an enemy and
were passive previously; this will cause the monster
to transition to passive once they are done fighting
but otherwise has no affect if they weren't passive.
-1 = No change to state.
0 = Set to Angry, normal reaction on sight.
1 = Set to Passive, won't attack unless provoked.
2 = Toggle to opposite of current state.
|wait|int|[-8388608,8388608]|0|Ignored unless -1 for activate only once.

5+s|path_corner
5+|Point
5+|ID1
5+|Waypoint for entities to use for following.  Typically used for func_train and
monsters.  Capable of stopping indefinitely, restarting after stopping at the
corner, waiting at the corner a specific amount of time, splitting the path to
an alternative corner, and triggering targets when this corner is reached.
|targetname `REQUIRED`|string 3+|Name of current path corner
|corner_event|string 3+|Name of target(s) to trigger when used or touched.
|corner_route|int|[0,1,2,3,4,5]|0|Change path_corner route.
1 = Forward
2 = Alternative forward
3 = Backward
4 = Exact using `state`
5 = Random
|corner_switch|int|[-1,0,1,2]|0|Change spawnflags REVERSE.
-1 = No
0 = Do nothing
1 = Yes
2 = Toggle
|corner_pause|int|[-1,0,1,2]|0|Change spawnflags NOPAUSE.
-1 = No
0 = Do nothing
1 = Yes
2 = Toggle
|corner_pstate|int|[-1,0,1,2]|0|Change passive state, on monsters only.
-1 = Off
0 = Do nothing
1 = On
2 = Toggle
|state|int|[1,2,3,4,5]|1|Starting route. This changes when passed based on `spawnflags`.
1 = Forward, uses `target`
2 = Alternative forward, uses `target2`
3 = Backward, uses `targetback`
|target|string 3+|Targetname of FORWARD route
|target2|string 3+|Alternative FORWARD route
|targetback|string 3+|Override default BACKWARD route
|delay|float|[-8388608,8388608]|0.00|Random amount of time to pause here.
|alpha|float|[0,1.00]|0.35|Override for visual arrows with developer > 0.
|speed|float|[0,8388608]|0|Change speed of func_train here.  0 does nothing.
5+|spawnflags:
1 EXACT : Exact route logic (unchecked=random route choices).
2 INSTANT : Move instantly to this corner if next destination.
4 REVERSE : Train direction is reversed for next corner.
8 NOPAUSE : Train does not pause on this path corner.
5+|Compatability support but not intended for normal usage
|corner_speed|float|[0,8388608]|0|Duplicate of `speed`.
