BRIEFING

COMMAND
This is your team.  I know you've all been pulled from your regular units, but this is a special assignment, a joint op between Americans, Aussies, Brits, and the Scotts.
First up is an American, Mac, the Heavy Weapons expert.  He's not afraid to waist ammo--and lots of it.  He may be a bit rowdy, but he's great with a Perforator.
Next we have Duke, the Demolition expert.  This Scott can flatten any building in minutes and packs enough demo charges in his pack take out an army.
Then there's Frank, the Brittish Special Weapons expert.  He can turn anything into a weapon, but mostly he likes using the enemy's weapons against 'em.
Finally we have the Tech, the other American.  There's nothing the Corporal can't hack or hotwire.  He's a great shot too.

You've all been trained in stealth which is why we need you for this mission.
Your mission is to infiltrate our top secret slipgate production base, The NAME.  Quake's forces took over the base some time ago during the Slipgate Rift Incident.  They all came in through the sliptest sector during one of the routine checks on one of the slipgates.  Anyhow they have complete control of all of the functions of the entire complex.  They are using it to mass produce bad slipgates that are preprogrammed to send Quake minions through to our bases when the slipgates are delivered to them.  Several of our bases have already had several deliveries of these Trojan Slipgates, which were dismantled before too many of the monstrosities made it through.

Once your in, you'll need to disable any slipgate production systems.  Frank and Corporal, that's your job.
Also, HQ wants the base destroyed so that Quake can't use it later.  What we need you to do is set demo charges on all of the support columns in the base.  Also you'll need to set charges on the generators.  Duke can 'andle that.

That shouldn't be too 'ard, now, so long as you remain undetected until Corporal disables the bulkhead security lock that would cut you off from chance of completing your mission and from escaping the base should it be activated.

By the way, did I mention the base was underground?  That shouldn't be too much of an issue.
Good Luck, I will be providing you with intel during your mission.  Go get em'.


MISSION STORY DIALOGUE

INFIL
==========
COMMAND
Look alive and listen up!  You've all been dropped at different points to enter the base where you'll be most useful.
Mac, make your way to the supply storage sector and hang tight.

MAC
K got it!

COMMAND
Corporal, get to the security center and disable the bulkheads, and open any other doors you can.  You may have to do a little wire-work.

CORPORAL
Why do I always get the tough jobs?  (low and grumbly)

COMMAND
Frank, you'll get into the armory and hijack some of their equipment, you'll also want to take all their explosives and dispose of them so they can't use them against us later.  Also, make sure you tamper with any other equipment in there.

FRANK
Yes sir!  (serious)

...

DUKE
Uh...what about me then?

COMMAND
Just get in and wait for the security to be disabled.  You'll be planting explosives everywhere after that.

DUKE
Sounds right good, sir!

(COMMAND) if player stays put i.e. does not trigger a trigger
Corporal, what are ya doin'?  Get along now!


SNEAKING
====================
DUKE
Mac, what are you doin'?

MAC
Well, the man said to hang tight.

DUKE
Just get to storage already, we've got no time for shenanigans, lad.

MAC
Fine, pack me away till Christmas, why dontchya?

DUKE
There's an idea!

MAC
*grunts*

COMMAND
Move along you two.


SECURITY CENTER
====================
CORPORAL
Okay, I'm at the Security Center.  What now?

COMMAND
Disable the Bulkhead Security Lock.  There should be an off switch somewhere near the main controls.

(CORPORAL) when player walks over to trigger
Big red button?

COMMAND
Yeah, with the stripes around it.
-=-=-
Alright, now you'll have to just hack the security panel on the right, the one with all the blinking lights.

CORPORAL
"Just hack"?  Real simple right.

(MAC) after player does nothing
What's the hold up?

(FRANK)
Don't rush him.

(MAC)  impatiently
Just smash the thing already and let's get on with it!
-=-=-
COMMAND
Well, that's not what I meant by "hack", but suprisingly that did it.
Okay people, the Bulkhead Security Lock has been overridden.  It's time to make some noise.  Corporal, get to the Slipgate Production Sector and start disabling the machinery.  Frank, move to assist the Corporal with the Slipgates.  Duke, start planting explosives on the main supports.  Mac, stay put.

ALL TOGETHER BUT MAC
Yessir!

MAC
Ah come on!

COMMAND
We'll need you in a bit Mac, don't worry.  Oh and everyone, keep it quiet till everyone's in position.  We want 'em to think we're everywhere when things start lightin' up.  To spread 'em out so as to not have one or two of ya fight the whole lot of 'em.


SLIPGATE PRODUCTION SECTOR
========================================
FRANK
Hey corporal.  Aren't you slow as molasses.

CORPORAL
Hey.

FRANK
Command, we're at the Pad-Maker.

COMMAND
Copy Frank, get to work.

DUKE
Seeeettiinnnggg charges...... one down more to go.  Moving along.

COMMAND
Good.  Try not to whistle.

DUKE
Aww! (cheerfully)

COMMAND
And didn't I tell you to wait till Corporal and Frank were in position.

DUKE
I'm being quiet, sir.  Don't you worry.

FRANK
Um, Command, we have a lot of blinkers around the pad producer.

COMMAND
You are clear to engage.

FRANK
Copy that, on my mark....go!

(FRANK) if player starts shooting too soon	TODO:: Test this out.
Hey that was mine!
-=-=-
FRANK
Slipgate gaurds neutralized.

MAC
Aww!  I wanna shoot some'n'.

COMMAND
Don't, you'll only alert the whole base to our presence.

(FRANK) after a few minutes
Well, your the Tech, how do we shut this thing down?

(FRANK) after a while
We haven't got all day, get to work disabling this.
||
(FRANK)
Stop messing around and kill the machine already!
||
(COMMAND)
Corporal, try jamming the mechanism.
||
(COMMAND)
Corporal, how's it coming?

(CORPORAL)
I'm working on it...
-=-=-
CORPORAL
That got it.

FRANK
Finally, now lets get the other machine.  You sure are slow for a tech expert, you know that.

COMMAND
Frank, quit buggin' him.
-=-=-
FRANK
Engaging the enemy at the slip engine creator.

FRANK
Got one.  Got another.  Enemies down.

COMMAND
Frank, you don't have to tell us your every little move, just finish your task.

FRANK
Fine then.

COMMAND
Keep your remarks to yourself.
-=-=-
CORPORAL
Slipgate production neutralized.

COMMAND
Good, move to assist Duke.  He's near your position, you can help him set the charges.

MAC
Say, why do Corporal and Frank get all the fun?

DUKE
I'm having a blast.  Or at least I will soon.

MAC
Where do they get off with all the action?

COMMAND
Mac, your needed to assist in extraction.  Everyone will be making their way out through the freight elevator in your sector.  We need you there for if we need you.

MAC
If!!?!?

COMMAND
I mean when. (hurriedly)

MAC
Uh huh... (sarcastically)


CREW SECTOR, THEN TO MINE
=============================
DUKE
There're a lot of blinkers in my area.  I could use some help.  I'm havin' trouble movin' without 'em spottin' me.

COMMAND
Frank, Corporal, why aren't you with Duke yet.

FRANK
We've run into a lot of resistance.

COMMAND
Duke, think you can handle 'em till Frank and Corporal can get to you.  It would help if drew attention away from Frank and Corporal.

DUKE
Maybe... but I'll try to keep it quiet.

FRANK
Command, we are meeting with heavy resistance in the crew sector.  They just keep coming.

COMMAND
Mac, do you think you can get to them.

MAC
Yeah hah!  Finally, action!

...

FRANK
I've been hit!

CORPORAL
Man down!  Man down!

COMMAND
Mac, where are you?

MAC
I'm a little busy with a small army of my own.

FRANK
Corporal, take my Laser Cannon.

(FRANK)  if player doesn't take it
Get over here and take my Laser Cannon! (very angry)

DUKE
Corporal, Frank, you've got another large group coming to you.  Command, do I have clearance to blow the columns I've already set.

COMMAND
Negative.  You could cause a cave in and destroy all of you, don't blow any charges until you've made it to the freight lift.

FRANK
I... I... ahhh!

CORPORAL
Frank's down and out sir.

COMMAND
Mac, Where are you, the Corporal is in trouble.

MAC
I'm almost to Duke.

DUKE
I'm layin' down some shells on 'em.  They're everywhere!  I should never have opened fire.  They're all after me now.

COMMAND
Corporal what's your status!

CORPORAL
I've got 'em all here.  Moving to assist Duke.

MAC
Knock knock! *boom* *boom*

DUKE
About time! *bang bang bang*


MEET UP WITH DUKE AND MAC
==============================
MAC
Hey that one was mine!

DUKE
Yours!  I got him fair and square.

MAC
He was shooting at me!

DUKE
Shooter's keepers!

MAC
Oh yeah well wimpy weeper.

DUKE
Hey, you got plenty.

MAC
We all got plenty, but that one was mine!

DUKE
Says who, I shot him.

MAC
Says me!

COMMAND
Cut it out you two!  Get to setting those charges!

DUKE
Here take some of....wait.  I had 'em right here in my pack.

MAC
Aw howdya lose the charges?

DUKE
My bag was unzipped.

MAC
Were you rolling again?

DUKE
Dive rolling is... well, ya know... tactical.

MAC
Tactical! huh!

COMMAND
Duke... where are the charges? Duke?

DUKE
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'...

MAC
Don't tell me that's them way down there.

DUKE
Aye, that's them waaay down there.

MAC
I told you not to tell me that!

COMMAND
Well now, this sets us back.  Duke!  You've got to be more careful.

DUKE
Well maybe corporal can axe down the supports.

MAC
Ha ha.  Great going.  Now how are we supposed to finish the mission.

DUKE
Didn't Frank get some charges from the Armory?

COMMAND
Yes, but I had him dispose of them, and wherever he put them we don't know.  Poor mate.

MAC
Say I passed some sort of mine on the way over here.

DUKE
Oooh!  A land mine?!?  I could use one of those!

MAC
Not that kind of mine!  A mine with rocks n stuff.  Ya know.

COMMAND
Yes the base was built on top of an ol' crystal mine.  The crystals are what power the slipgates.  Perhaps there is some explosives down there, but there still may be some elsewhere.  Corporal, go to the mine and look for some C-4.  Mac, get back to the Storage Sector and start lookin' there.  Duke look in the armory, maybe Frank missed some of the explosives.


MINE
===========
CORPORAL
Made it to the mine.

COMMAND
Good start looking.  Duke?

DUKE
Loodaloodaloo... I'm a-lookin', but Frank did a good job.

COMMAND
Duke, how can you be so cheerful?  You just possibly messed this entire mission up.

DUKE
I still get to blow up 8 support columns. :) !!

MAC
I'm just glad I finally got to shoot som'in'.  Speaking of which, *shot* *shot*  Yeah heah!
-=-=-
CORPORAL
I found the C-4.

COMMAND
Good, how much?

CORPORAL
Enough.

COMMAND
Duke, your in luck.

MAC
Aww, looks like we won't be beating you up after class after all.

DUKE
Good!  I'm on my way to the mine now.

COMMAND
Okay.  Corporal, take some of the C-4 and get to the Generator Sector.  You'll need to plant some charges in each of the 6 emergency exhaust tubes.  Duke, you can finish setting charges on all the support columns.

DUKE
Sure thing!

MAC
Hey, I'm at storage again.  They seem to be gathering up supplies.  There all over this place.  I'll can keep quiet, if you really want me to.

DUKE
If only that were possible.

MAC
Hey!

COMMAND
Mac, you can hide out there till the others finish setting the charges.  Try not to draw too much attention.

MAC
Oh is this art class now.

DUKE
Just stay hidden.


GENERATOR SECTOR
========================
CORPORAL
At the generators.  Don't see any exhaust tubes.

COMMAND
They should be closed.  They'll look like octagon hatches on the sides of the generators.
You'll need to get to the controls to open them, before you can place the charges inside.

CORPORAL
Mmhmm.
-=-=-
MAC
Um, just FYI, there are a lot of blinkers and grunts headed your way.

DUKE
My way?

MAC
No, Corporal's way.

DUKE

COMMAND
Keep setting charges.  Mac, can you distract them.

MAC
I'll do more than that.  I'll paint a niiice picture.
-=-=-
CORPORAL
Charges set.

COMMAND
Good get over to the security sector.  They're trying to bring on the base's defenses.  Oh and Corporal, there's a lot of movement in your area.  Stay alert.

CORPORAL
Copy.

MAC
Uh, what defenses?

COMMAND
The place is armed with laser turrets everywhere.  The blinkers are trying to get 'em up 'n' runnin'.

MAC
Great what next?

DUKE
I'm just about finished up around the mine.

COMMAND
Good, see if you can get to the security sector.

DUKE
Yeah, I still have to set some demo-packs there.

MAC
Command...*shot shot shot*...they must have n army topside, cuz they just sent down a whole mess of em on the freight lift.

COMMAND
Hold 'em off,  Duke and Corporal should be finishing up shortly.


SECURITY CENTER (AGAIN)
==========================
DUKE
We're at the s'curity sector, but no-enn's home.

COMMAND
They must've gone after Mac.  Set the charges quick and get over to 'im.

DUKE
