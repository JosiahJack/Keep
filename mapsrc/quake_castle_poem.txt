Quake Castle
by Qmaster

A.  The castle will rise from its vortal depths
B.  Scuttled these demons from their worlds above
C.  Fallen into the abyss...
D.  ...the resting place under universal vortex funnel
E.  At the small end beneath everything. Underworld.
F.  Final barrier, protection between the stars and Hell itself.
G.  Quake's domain, Overlord of all the world's rejects.
