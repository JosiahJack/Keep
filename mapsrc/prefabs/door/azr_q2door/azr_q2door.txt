Notes: A quick hack at a Quake2 styled door I am using in one of my 
       levels. Used vertex editing instead of brush subtraction.
       There are 2 func_door entities included. The speeds are set pretty
       good so I wouldn't play with them too much. They are different
       speeds becuase one door is larger than the other. With the current
       speeds set they close together perfectly.

Editors used: qED v2.0
	      WinQoole - for vertex editing

Entites: Yes. 2 func_door entities

Textures: mindr1_1_1 for the doors
	  metal24_4_1 for the frame
	  Textures are from Quake2 (.wad file included)

Build time: about 1½ hours from scratch

Files: You should have: azr_q2dor.txt
			azr_q2door.qGP or azr_q2door.map
			azr_q2door.wad
