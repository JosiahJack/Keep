Chton door -  a component originated from Matthew "Bushboy" Trow
              at The Quake Prefab Park and adapted for qED by
              JF Groleau.

        TEXTURES USED:

        dr07_1 for the door faces
        metal1_3 for the door edges and frame trim
        metal4_4 for the door frame

        ENTITIES USED:

        func_door

        WHAT TO DO:

        Extract the .qgp file from the archive and place it in the
        c:\Program Files\qED\Group folder. Once in qED, insert this prefab
        using the menu item "Group" + "load from library". The origin of this
        prefab is at the bottom center of the door assembly. The position
        or offset of the inserted group will be referenced to the offset of
        the currently selected item in the level outline window. The group
        can then be moved and rotated to suit the map design. Some texture
        alignment might be required after these operations. The 3D-Matrix
        university provide exhaustive tutorials on this topic.

        FUNCTIONALITY:

        2 func_door entities were added to make the door entirely functional
        and their targetname attributes have been left blank so it will operate
        like a normal door. The door is similar to the one in the Quake
        level E1M6 "Door to Chton". A cutting subgroup with a negative brush 
        the same size as the door frame is also provided for wall cutting.
        Just move the wall brush you want to in the cutting group and do a
        "subtract brushes". Optimize the resulting brushes if necessary and
        move them back to their original group.

        OPTIONS:

        Set the func_door attributes to your liking for sound, speed, lip, etc.
        and the targetname if you want it to be operated by a trigger entity.
        Also, if you wish to reduce the brush count of the door or change its
        look to a more basic type of metal door, just delete the trims around
        the frame by removing the entire trim subgroup in the frame group.
