Half-life Red Door Prefab
------------------------------
10/2/1999

 18 Solids
108 Faces
  0 Point Entities
  3 Solid Entities

This is the red door with a window used in the office
complex here and there. The window swings with the door
when it opens. These doors are quite useful to create 
an atmosphere and reduce viewable texture count. Included
in the prefab is a door pane. Try the attached example 
map where you can frag Barney.
