This prefab is my version of a light fixture that comes from the Malice
add-on to Classic Quake.  Hope 'ya like it...I'm not *real* skilled with
Quake editing, but I think this is a nice light fixture.  Makes for some
*great* shadows.

This prefab can be rotated to be placed on walls, ceilings, and floors.  It
must be grouped (there are only 2 sections) to stretch correctly, but
that's not hard at all.
