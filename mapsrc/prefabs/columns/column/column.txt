----------

A not so basic roman column


5 brushes/solids
50 faces

The fifty faces relate to the five eight sided polygons.
eight faces + top & bottom each.

You can easily use eight of these columns with an addition
of 640 faces or 80 4 sided brushes/solids giving an average
R_SPEED middle value of 380, depending on your economical
design structure.
They differ from your average quake columns because of the
'big to smaller (can't think of the word) bottom to
top sloping effect'.

Created for a development level which hopefully will be
available one month after 25 sept 97.
