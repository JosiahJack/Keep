Columns - Matthew 'Bushboy' Trow
--------------------------------

Here's three columns - vertex manipulation has been used.

column1.map - Column which bulges in the middle, used
              three eight sided cylinders and two squares.
              5 brushes
              42 faces

column2.map - Pointy egyptian style column, used
              two squares & one spike.
              3 brushes
              17 faces

column3.map - Byzantine style column, used
              three 16 sided cylinders and one square.
              4 brushes
              48 faces

Be careful with the amount of columns used in one area, especially column3.

***NOTE: column3 had bad brushes... I will redo it and add it here later...
