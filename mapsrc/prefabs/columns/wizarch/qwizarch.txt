Wiz arch - a component originated from Dustin Geeraert (aka
           aBivr) at The Quake Prefab Park and adapted for
           qED by JF Groleau.

        TEXTURES USED:

        wizmet1_3 for the frame arch and sides
        wizmet2_2 for the frame blocks
        window01_4 for the stained glass pane


        WHAT TO DO:

        Extract the .qgp file from the archive and place it in the
        c:\Program Files\qED\Group folder. Once in qED, insert this prefab
        using the menu item "Group" + "load from library". The origin of this
        prefab is at the bottom and middle of the arch. The position
        or offset of the inserted group will be referenced to the offset of
        the currently selected item in the level outline window. The group
        can then be moved and rotated to suit the map design. Some texture
        re-alignment might be required after these operations. Please remember
        that texture alignment is everything in this particular prefab.


        OPTIONS:

        The window can be re-textured to a different stained glass texture and
        still look good provided that the texture has the same dimensions as
        the original.
