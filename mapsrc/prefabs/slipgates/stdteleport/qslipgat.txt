The Standard Teleporter - a component originated from Steve Fukuda at
                          The QuakeLab and adapted for qED by
                          JF Groleau.

TEXTURES USED:

        *teleport for center fill
        ecop1_1 for surrounding frame

ENTITIES USED:

        info_teleport_destination & trigger_teleport

WHAT TO DO:

        Extract the .qgp file from the archive and place it in the
        c:\Program Files\qED\Group folder. Once in qED, insert this prefab
        using the menu item "Group" + "load from library". The origin of this
        prefab is at the middle center of the teleporter. The position
        or offset of the inserted group will be referenced to the offset of
        the currently selected item in the level outline window. The group
        can then be moved and rotated to suit the map design. Texture
        alignment will not required after these operations if the original
        teleporter textures are kept. Relocate the supplied info_teleport_
        _destination entity and set its angle attribute as required.

FUNCTIONALITY:

        The basic principle is the presence of two entities:
        trigger_teleport and info_teleport_destination with their respective
        target and targetname attributes set to the same value. All the rest
        is really just cosmetics. One detail to note is that the teleporter
        core brush should not be a child of the trigger_teleport entity
        because that will render it invisible in the game. In this prefab,
        it exists as a child of the "construction brushes" group for
        convenience but it could as well have been a stand-alone brush.
        This works perfectly and actually saves a brush in the model.
        Another point to mention is that as the player reappears at the
        teleporter destination coordinates, he keeps moving forward in the
        direction of entity angle even he enters the teleporter very slowly.
        If you want to make the player reappear on a small platform or some
        otherwise unreachable area, place some kind of obstacle to prevent
        the player from falling off the very instant he materializes.

OPTIONS:

        Rename, if desired, the target attribute of the trigger_teleport and
        the matching targetname attribute of the info_teleport_destination.
        The angle attribute of the info_teleport_destination sets the
        direction player will face upon exiting the teleporter. Its position
        sets where in the map the player will reappear (can be anywhere).
        Set the spawnflags attribute of the trigger_teleport to 1 to make
        the teleporter work only with players (monsters can still walk through
        it, though). Setting the spawnflags attributes to 2 is supposed to
        make the teleporter silent but I nave not been able to make this work.
        I have no idea why. In any case, try it.
