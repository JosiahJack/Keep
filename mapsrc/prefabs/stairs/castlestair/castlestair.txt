This is something I've been wanting to get right for some time -
a spiral staircase within a castle turret which can be made as
high as you wish yet still have decent doors into the staircase
and also fits within a 64x64 grid.

The stairs go up from door to door 256 units, quite a good
figure to use when map building.

Enjoy !!
